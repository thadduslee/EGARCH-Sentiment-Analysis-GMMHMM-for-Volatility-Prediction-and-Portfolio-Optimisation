Here's why I think that:

* **Cloud -** Microsoft's Azure Growth was below market expectations (if you strip out OpenAI) - this also impacted AMZN stock price following Microsoft's earnings due to fears Cloud revenue broadly was decelerating QoQ with Capital spend ramping. However, GCP just reported and they grew cloud materially - with impressive backlog as well. I expect AWS to beat estimates and post 22-24% growth for AWS due to the following. 
   1. Azure doesn't have strong custom silicon (they are trying to catch-up with Maya) compared to GCP (TPUs) and AWS (Trainium) and I believe this will truly be more apparent this quarter.
   2. Anthropic is *materially* over-performing estimates - they raised Revenue projections for 2025 & 2026 and their Enterprise in-roads and tools is one reason there was such a large sell-off in SaaS companies the past few days. Anthropic predominantly uses AWS **and** Amazon is one of the lead investors - they will show AWS growth from Anthropic usage & a paper-gain on their investment 
   3. AWS is still the gorilla in the room - they are still the primary cloud provider for most enterprises and government orgs ($581M Air Force contract announced a few weeks ago)
* **Retail -** There have been reports Prime shipments were the largest in it's history this Christmas season - I think as more people consolidate purchasing, especially with economic pressure - there will be larger spend on AMZN retail & groceries per subscriber than historically
* **Advertising -** AMZN is monetizing it's properties more with high margin $ ads. Prime Video, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), etc.

Even without potential margin expansion from restructurings and robotics in their fulfilment centers, I think this will be an extremely strong earnings report from Amazon. Whether the market reacts favorably or unfavorably due to increases in Capital spend (like it has with Microsoft & Google) will be a different story. I think based on the above and the potential for a Prime subscription price hike to mitigate tariff impacts (unless SCOTUS rules on it), AMZN is due for a stock run-up. The timing is not ideal with a broad tech sell-off the past week (and is why I'd stick to stock not short-dated options), but my Price Target is $250 - $260 after earnings and $300 EOY. Note this is not investment advice whatsoever and solely meant for discussion.

Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat. The stock is down over 90% from all time highs in 2021, currently trading at roughly $6 per share with a $10B market cap. The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management, best personified by their hedonistic CEO (Evan Spiegel) who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years, creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune. This, coupled with strong competition from $META, has driven sentiment to perhaps an all-time low.

But behind all of this I see, and the data tells me, that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential, currently generating its highest revenue in company history, something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenue-model and the launch of their heavily researched & developed AR Glasses.

*Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1...*

I have been plotting a $snap long for weeks now, and given the recent sell-off (1-month decline of -30%), I think being long going into earnings offers amazing risk/reward. I will try to concisely summarize my stance:

# Snapchat+ Subscriptions:

* **The Perfect Rugpull -** Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters. Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025, effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories. The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscription-based revenue and becomes less reliant on ads. Net Profitability will increase: non paying users = less AWS expenses, Paying users = high-margin revenue
* **The Data -** Kevory tried compiling [data](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qrcgii/more_dd_on_snapchat_adoption_after_mandatory/), i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications
* **My Subscription Forecast -** I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount, as well as users who pay for storage only:

|**Quarter**|**Subscribers**|**Other Revenue**|**Analysis**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Q1 2025**|**14 Million**|\~$155M|Shift toward creator-focused features.|
|**Q2 2025**|**15 Million**|\~$170M|Steady organic growth. 9% of total revenue.|
|**Q3 2025**|**17 Million**|**$190M**|**Pre-Storage Spike:** Accelerated 35% YoY growth. 12.6% of total revenue.|
|**Q4 2025 (Est)**|**19.5M - 20M**|**$245M+**|**The Storage Catalyst:** First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact. Up to 15% of total revenue.|

# Spectacles (AR Glasses):

* **Launch of market-leading AR Glasses** \- Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026. Has Spent over $3 Billion in R&D over the past decade. Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem (400k+ developers) and in certain aspects of hardware.
* **Superior Balance Sheet -** Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $Snap look superior in the future (less R&D costs), while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META. 

# Management:

There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down:

* **SBC (share based compensation) -** historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses. I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential. Things can only get better from here.

*Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1...*

* **Meta competition -** because of Spiegel’s unwillingness to sell to Meta, Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta. Meta also has in-house datacenters and a more-optimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable. Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU - big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order. Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META. What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitude/approach, stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company, with 90-day mission-cycles and 100x returns.

# The Upcoming Earnings:

* **Christmas and AI Pump -** Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge. Meta recently beat massively much thanks to ai-driven ad optimization, something I forecast also has helped Snap. Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future.
* **Mean reversion -** Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings. Currently -20% on the week. With sentiment being at all time lows, I expect a classic inverse move.

Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI, I think you all know **Anthropic** has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO, you cannot miss out on this one.

Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion, **Low-risk/High-return Tickers** that directly stand to gain from the IPOs:

1. $SATS - SpaceX

With around **45-50%** of their mkt cap in **SpaceX** shares, roughly **$10\~$11B,** this ticker stands to gain the most from the **SpaceX** IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV, all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into **$DTECH** or **$RKLB.**

2. $MSFT - OpenAI

The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock, but it's all about to change for the better (for calls) in 2026. I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of \~$540 and all I can see is **unlimited upside at a 23% discount.** With an **absurd 27% ownership stake in OpenAI,** even if Altman shit himself on live tv you'll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up.

3. $SKM - Anthropic

If you want exposure to **Anthropic. Co,** look no further than **$SKM**, a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry, merely a subdivision of their parent company SK, one of the country's largest chaebols. With a dominance of **50.5 of all shares** in their local market, **$SKM** is a solid investment even without their major stakes in **Anthropic. Co.** A monopoly in their industry at a relative all-time low is a great investment nonetheless, but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings. **They hold an ownership stake of approximately** **0.58%\~0.7%,** which may not seem like a lot, but relative to their **\~$9B mkt cap**, it makes up a significant portion of **$SKM's valuation at around 20%-25% of the company.** They've also got a joint partnership with **Anthropic,** together developing a **Multilingual LLM** tailored for the telecommunications industry. The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on, and the general public knows little to nothing about **Anthropic or their projects with SKM**, so we are early investors here. And, if you look at their Ytd/1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming.

my current positions are:

$SATS: +1 contracts of $9.80 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $160

$MSFT: +2 contracts of $4.90 ac Expiry - 11/20 pt $600

$SKM: +5 contracts of $1.89 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $41

>Oracle Corp. plans to raise $45 billion to $50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI’s growth.

>Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company’s largest cloud customers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp., OpenAI, TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp., the company said in a statement Sunday.

>The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligence-linked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off. The company’s shares have fallen around 50% from its record price on Sept. 10, wiping out roughly $460 billion in market value.

>Shares fell about 3% in premarket trading on Monday. Oracle’s stock had declined 2.6% to close at $164.58 in New York on Friday.

>Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle’s free cash flow negative, where it is expected to stay until 2030, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years, largely on semiconductors and leases.

>“If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.

>The company plans to raise half of the funds via equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an at-the-market equity program of as much as $20 billion.

>Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investment-grade debt rating, wrote John DiFucci, an analyst at Guggenheim, in a January note.

>The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026. The company borrowed $18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year’s largest corporate bond offerings.

>But the debt market may not have an appetite for this much investment-grade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps, Luria said. Issuing equity may also hurt the company’s stock price, he said.

>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering, and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the at-the-market issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering, Oracle said.

>As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble, investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle, which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis.

>A key part of Oracle’s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI, which has committed to spending about $300 billion to rent servers from Oracle. OpenAI is not profitable, adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns.

>Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle. The timing, “could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday’s open,” Luria said.

*(For disclosure: I don't hold any position in $ANPA, nor do I plan to. I wrote this write up since I found it interesting, and also intersects with other work I'm doing)*

***TLDR: Khaby Lame, the most-followed creator on TikTok, sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $6m in revenue... yes, this is real.***

***A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality, with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publicly-known employee and hardly any public presence. The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most high-profile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs.***

***Simply put, the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets.***

Hola fellow regards,

If you’ve been reading the news lately, you might’ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok’s most followed creator, Khaby Lame, selling his name and likeness for just shy of a [billion dollars.](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/worlds-biggest-tiktoker-from-senegal-sells-company-in-dollar900m-deal/z9nr4ex)

It’s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers, and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame’s success story. The laid-off machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars *looks* built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal. 

According to the SEC filing, Khaby Lame sold *Step Distinctive Limited* from a Hong Kong-based holding company, *Rich Sparkle Limited*, for the consideration of $975m USD, through **the issuance of 75m ordinary shares** of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive’s shareholders. No cash got exchanged at all, purely shares.

Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ANPA, and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing, up to 600% from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point.

[Quite a return if you ask me.](https://preview.redd.it/c424745w6zgg1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c941f3186ecab4713ed82a0b21f57eee141894)

Yet take an actual dive into the company that’s acquiring Khaby’s company, and more specifically, who even underwrote them within the first place, and you’re going to get a picture filled with so many red-flags you’d think it was a USSR propaganda piece…

# Rich Sparkle is a ""printing company"" that has no business making a deal of this nature... like at all.

With a consideration of nearly $975 million dollars, most would think that Rich Sparkle is, in some way, a firm that’s engaged within the social media or technology space. Maybe an A.I influencer company or something?

It’s what I thought too, but Rich Sparkle’s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements. Yes. Printing and designing financial statements.

[Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th, 2025.](https://preview.redd.it/edbr2kyz7zgg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=25f537806165f65d87c5de4d2a9cd560301470de)

A financial statements printing company is paying $975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok’s most popular influencer.  What’s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they’re paying Khaby Lame for this company. The company only raked in just $5.88m in revenue the previous year, yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars?

[Again, per the prospectus.](https://preview.redd.it/knix5nka8zgg1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a1387f49442563acf5459cdcd5914c1df3aa5ed)

$ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th, 2025, raising just **$5m in IPO proceeds** [**(6-k pg.11)**](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=319481647&type=PDF&symbol=ANPA&companyName=Rich+Sparkle+Holdings+Limited&formType=6-K&formDescription=Report+of+foreign+private+issuer+pursuant+to+Rule+13a-16+or+15d-16+under+the+Securities+Exchange+Act+of+1934&dateFiled=2025-09-30)**.**  The company issued out just 10% of their current shares, which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $50m come the time of the IPO (shares would eventually dilute out to \~5% of outstanding shares being publicly traded).

Just a month later, the stock that initially IPO'd at price of around $4 is trading at [$30 bucks and has added nearly $250m in market capitalization](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ANPA/history/?period1=1738456733&period2=175461 ...[truncated]","TikTok's most popular influencer sold his company for $975m... to a sketchy Chinese ""printing"" company doing $6m in revenue: a write-up.

*(For disclosure: I don't hold any position in $ANPA, nor do I plan to. I wrote this write up since I found it interesting, and also intersects with other work I'm doing)*

***TLDR: Khaby Lame, the most-followed creator on TikTok, sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $6m in revenue... yes, this is real.***

***A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality, with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publicly-known employee and hardly any public presence. The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most high-profile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs.***

***Simply put, the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets.***

Hola fellow regards,

If you’ve been reading the news lately, you might’ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok’s most followed creator, Khaby Lame, selling his name and likeness for just shy of a [billion dollars.](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/worlds-biggest-tiktoker-from-senegal-sells-company-in-dollar900m-deal/z9nr4ex)

It’s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers, and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame’s success story. The laid-off machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars *looks* built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal. 

According to the SEC filing, Khaby Lame sold *Step Distinctive Limited* from a Hong Kong-based holding company, *Rich Sparkle Limited*, for the consideration of $975m USD, through **the issuance of 75m ordinary shares** of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive’s shareholders. No cash got exchanged at all, purely shares.

Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ANPA, and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing, up to 600% from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point.

[Quite a return if you ask me.](https://preview.redd.it/c424745w6zgg1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c941f3186ecab4713ed82a0b21f57eee141894)

Yet take an actual dive into the company that’s acquiring Khaby’s company, and more specifically, who even underwrote them within the first place, and you’re going to get a picture filled with so many red-flags you’d think it was a USSR propaganda piece…

# Rich Sparkle is a ""printing company"" that has no business making a deal of this nature... like at all.

No, I am not saying sndk is a better investment than other companies like MU, or Seagate, or NVDA. That is up to you to decide. I am only saying that this is The Best Pure Momentum play right now. If SNDK grasps even a fraction of the attention that those other names got, this thing will really move.

Whether you believe the price will go UP or DOWN, this stock will move quick and you will make a lot of money if you are right. Genuinely no hate if you short it, because i believe it'll just add to the momentum when you buy back.

As for me, I believe its going higher. As we move through the next few weeks of Tech Earnings, i believe the momentum will only get stronger. Keep in mind, Nvidia's earnings are Feb 25th. I have opened new positions, 700c Feb 20. I would've got feb27 or march (after nvda earnings) but I only work at Wendy's and couldn't afford them at the time.

A week after the Groq acquisition, $GFS finally started climbing rapidly, from $35, to over $48 on January 27th, before pulling back to its current price of $42.20.  Why the curious delayed reaction to the move?  I believe, because this stock is shorted to the gills, and *someone* can’t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out.  One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $GFS is currently shorted, Institutions hold 101.25% of the float, while a whopping 11.66% of that float is short, which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi’s…

For more confirmation that $GFS is dangerously shorted, on Dec 31st, just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals, Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere downgrading the stock, and dropping the stock nearly -4% on the day; instead of continuing its plunge, Bulls smelled blood in the water, and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $48 in less than a month.  One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 4/17/26 $45 Calls for $5.2M, then sold it for $14.2M on the price surge, and then doubled down with 4/17 $55 Calls for nearly $10M!  Clearly, they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 2/11, and that brings me to my first point of this post.

Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI, so they spent $20B on Groq AI Chips, and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips; if you’re Nvidia, you’re not gonna spend $20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips, so the next logical investment for $NVDA, is to buy a stake in $GFS itself.  That *MUST* be what that Options Whale is betting on, maybe an announcement on 2/11 earnings, and with $GFS so heavily shorted, this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $NVDA does intend to invest in $GFS.  To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries, below is the Daily OnBalance Volume \[OBV\] chart (ignore all those black lines in the middle, those are my Intra-day trendlines), the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure, to nearly hitting its Dec’22 ATHs, before pulling back, but still staying above the Gann Fan, and breaking that downward trend in just a single month!

$GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling, but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options, I believe Longs are betting on a run soon, with or without $NVDA buying a stake in $GFS, AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space, areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in. My position is 9 July 17th $45 Calls, wish my account were bigger………..

As always, this is not Financial Advice, don't blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet, this is all PURE speculation on my part.

**\[\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\*\]**

From u/Independent-Exam1863 comment below, the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with it's GR00Ts Robotics program.

For more confirmation that $GFS is dangerously shorted, on Dec 31st, just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals, Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere downgrading the stock, and dropping the stock nearly -4% on the day; instead of continuing its plunge, Bulls smelled blood in the water, and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $48 in less than a month.  One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 4/17/26 $45 Calls for $5.2M, then sold it for $14.2M on the price surge, and then doubled down with 4/17 $55 Calls for nearly $10M!  Clearly, they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 2/11, and that brings me to my first point of this post.

Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI, so they spent $20B on Groq AI Chips, and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips; if you’re Nvidia, you’re not gonna spend $20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips, so the next logical investment for $NVDA, is to buy a stake in $GFS itself.  That *MUST* be what that Options Whale is betting on, maybe an announcement on 2/11 earnings, and with $GFS so heavily shorted, this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $NVDA does intend to invest in $GFS.  To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries, below is the Daily OnBalance Volume \[OBV\] chart (ignore all those black lines in the middle, those are my Intra-day trendlines), the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure, to nearly hitting its Dec’22 ATHs, before pulling back, but still staying above the Gann Fan, and breaking that downward trend in just a single month!

$GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling, but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options, I believe Longs are betting on a run soon, with or without $NVDA buying a stake in $GFS, AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space, areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in. My position is 9 July 17th $45 Calls, wish my account were bigger………..

My read on the situation: the price is the consensus reached by many different players, most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading. They either panic sold or got margin called, deepening the crash.

In the Asian market however, there are institutions and governments who have a strategic or long term reason to buy, especially when they get a discount. They will be voting and primary driver of the monday opening price (since time zone is ahead for asia). So I am expecting a gap up and I bought both GLD and SLV calls right before close on Friday.

There’s still a lot of bullish sentiment, with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $320 based on strong user growth and AI integration.

*“… driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition.”*

Competition from what exactly? TikTok? The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons? Or Snap? The app that’s been effectively dead for years? I’ll leave Meta out of this because I don’t think it even needs addressing. The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms. Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would’ve made more sense for a bullish case. Not sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things.

Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher, showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair, Warsh. (Who knows, I’m not taking a stance there.) The point is, there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026, so how does that square with fears (atop of the previous points) of declining ad growth?

Between Reddit ads, its growing presence in search results, AI integration, and highly targeted user interests, Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI. There’s also the new verified profile feature, which could end up being meaningful long-term, even for marketing purposes.

All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me. There’s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which, honestly, should be another sign.

Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5, 2026.

I’ve recently been questioning that specific analyst, why there was such a reaction from it, but perhaps I had missed something on my end.

**P.S.** To everyone about to yell “it’s nothing but bots!” Yeah, there are bots everywhere among all platforms. However, you’d be surprised how many users *aren’t* bots. This gives me the same energy as people saying “that must be AI!” when it clearly isn’t.

Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now. I’ve watched people Google something, scroll straight past everything else, click the Reddit result to get their answer. They would also casually notice an ad while they’re there. That feels - important.

**BACKGROUND:**  
Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee. In-app prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat+. So I compiled data from 80 respondents (37k+ friends in total) to estimate Snap’s earning potential. 

**THE GOOD NEWS:**

I remain confident that subscription-based revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter, which should result in \~12.5% growth in run-rate revenue and \~25% bump in enterprise value expectation (though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot)

**THE BAD NEWS:**

The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat+ subs will not be realized as Q4 revenue, but will instead build rapidly over the next year. This is because of **(1)** steep first-month signup discounts, **(2)** in-app prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter, and **(3)** the fact that “Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription” (from 10-Q). (That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won’t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4).

Also, Apple’s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year.

**METHOD:**

(See Images 3 and 4)

I broke down user count by age group and location (US, EU, INDIA/ROW) using DAU reports from the 10Q. I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics. I multiplied the two matrices together, summed to get a demographic-weighted average of DAUs who are subscribed, then multiplied by total DAUs. I also multiplied by a “Zombie factor” to account for inactive users on respondents’ friend lists. 

This leads me to the 100% increase figure with assumptions:

* Of the average user’s friend list, 40% are DAU, 40% are MAU, and 20% are inactive.
* People over age 35 (making up 30% of the user base) are completely ignored. 
* $2/mo subscription plans are completely ignored.

**Assumption analysis**

INDIA:

India accounts for \~40% of users, so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight. I spent 5 hours on Azar (like Omegle but more popular in India), but I couldn’t get a single Indian user to give me their data (though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat+). So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 1/10 of those in the US for the same age group. I think this is reasonable because Snapchat+ is 50 Rupees per month in India, corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity.

DOUBLE-COUNTING:

I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed (as opposed to the friend-count-weighted method I used in my first post). **NOTE:** Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low (0.29), so this may not be necessary.

INACTIVE USERS:

Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis. Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs , I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap+ per DAU metric. Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs. As a 21-year old, I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this: A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity. Also, criminals love Snapchat for self-deleting texts. Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends.

**OTHER NOTES:**

I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap+ friends. I attribute this to an error in sampling; these users assumed that, because they were sent to a different page than was shown, their Snap+ friend count must be 0. This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection.

Snap doesn’t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q, instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards.

I won’t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid. Schwab was showing me +$19k in (totally fake) unrealized P&L on Tuesday based on mid-to-market rates (the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x). If anyone knows how to change this, please comment below.

**Safe to say I’m down a lot. But I haven’t sold anything.**

Will a SpaceX merger with Tesla allow for existing $TSLA shareholders indirect access to SpaceX? What are the implications of this?

\- Would Tesla shareholders gain meaningful exposure to SpaceX’s long-term upside?

\- Would this strengthen Tesla’s ecosystem narrative  or dilute its core focus?

ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it, without having spend the nearly $100k that most sell-side shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports? DBS has you covered!

here's the method

1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with ""equity research filetype:pdf"" on google. scroll a bit down, and you'll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock.  [for example, just searching up ""CVX equity reseach filetype:pdf"" got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron](https://www.google.com/search?q=CVX+equity+reseach+filetype%3Apdf&sca_esv=c1b77a2b127022e6&rlz=1C5OZZY_enCA1192US1194&sxsrf=ANbL-n6WP0y0-D4ppok9xYERHRP0wVhfJg%3A1769655057019&ei=Ect6ac13wP2m1A_s7PvwDA&ved=0ahUKEwiNxLHo3q-SAxXAvokEHWz2Hs4Q4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=CVX+equity+reseach+filetype%3Apdf&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiH0NWWCBlcXVpdHkgcmVzZWFjaCBmaWxldHlwZTpwZGZIqgdQlwNY6gVwAngBkAEAmAE9oAGwAaoBATO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgKgAgXCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHmAMA4gMFEgExIECIBgGQBgiSBwEyoAeHAbIHALgHAMIHAzAuMsgHBIAIAA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)
2. once you're there, press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at. using the chevron example, you change it from [https://www.dbs.com/content/article/pdf/US\_clover/Chevron.pdf](https://www.dbs.com/content/article/pdf/US_clover/Chevron.pdf) to [https://www.dbs.com/content/article/pdf/US\_clover/Goldman\_Sachs.pdf](https://www.dbs.com/content/article/pdf/US_clover/Goldman_Sachs.pdf) by just by changing that last part at the end (make sure to capitalize it!)

Today QQQ had a big break through 630 as tech earnings arrive. META, MSFT, AAPL, next week AMZN, AMD and more all reporting Q4 2025 earnings. I think despite all the political and trade turmoil, big tech is doing better than just fine, they are still booming.

META is expected to post an increasing profit in Q4 of $21B from $20.8B, YoY.

With an expected Q4 revenue of $58.45B from $48.39B, YoY. 

Estimated Q4 adjusted eps at $9.03.

The CapEx from AI is what is made Wallstreet nervous and is weighing on their reported profit, but that should to be priced in with the fall below 600 last year. (although this might raise concerns for some). I think once revenue is posted, investors will be put at ease.

The standout number is a staggering 20% increase in quarterly revenue YoY and it is what catches my eye that the fall from last quarter's CapEx made META actually  undervalued.

 With a solid EPS, they won't miss due to a one time tax, all the analysts are coming in with price targets around 800 or above for META as well.

To me, all this reads as a company ready to reclaim its proper valuation (currently undervalued). With some good guidance from Zuck, I am setting a personal price target/option exit at $720.

I bought 24 of these METU calls today around $32.30 with an exit plan of $41-$43.

Entire AI supply chain, from Blackwell to Apple’s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly. And they are sold out until 2027.

The general assumption is that an H100/Blackwell GPU is just silicon, but the chip sits on a substrate (that green board). If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow, the chip cracks and dies.

To prevent warping, you need Low CTE Glass (often called ""T-Glass""), which is currently manufactured by Nittobo (Japan) which is currently sold out, hence Apple/Qualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply.

Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ. They need a second source to reduce risk.

Also, they are the only non Chinese option. US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives, and Nittobo is maxed out. Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers (Unimicron, Nan Ya).

The stock is up 200% over the last year, but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news. Nittobo (Japan) didn't stop at a 2x; it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock. As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division (likely Q1/Q2 2026), the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock.

\*\*TLDR\*\*

PI market cap: $4.8B

Impinj manufactures UHF (RAIN) RFID tag integrated circuits (ICs). They sell more than about 15 billion per year. Impinj might sell a tag IC for $0.005-$0.02. Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others. Inlay manufacturers sell inlays (tag IC + antenna + substrate) to end customers to attach to their products. Tags can be little stickers, adhered to paper clothing tags, sewed nearly invisibly into clothing, hidden inside anything non-metallic or non-liquid, etc. Impinj also manufactures expensive stand-alone RFID readers, but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers. I don't have much to say about their readers.

Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICs/chips. Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly. Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10-year agreement to not sue over patents, which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034. David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches. For the next 8 years, Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP.

RAIN RFID is currently used in places like: Walmart, Inditex (clothing), UPS (package tracking, package-on-right-truck verification), Delta and United (baggage tracking), medicine tracking, car tires and other parts, etc. Supply chains and clothing, primarily.

Recent investor calls show they're starting to push food with Kroger. Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets, which may explain their current valuation, which is arguably high. They're starting in the bakery sections now.

Engineering deets you can skip if you're not technical: Tag ICs have been improving in performance, usually about 1-2dB (RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity) per generation / node shrink. This has been essential to the technology's capability and expanded usage. I asked Gemini about next node and it's guessing 20-something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound, which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not get smaller. Impinj knows this. Digital performance/capability/featureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes. Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology. Also, smaller node = more tag ICs per wafer = cheaper tag ICs, so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead. 20-something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not have a premium. Impinj requires cheap wafers.

Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls (do your own reading on this). I know Trump is fucking over US-EU relations and is causing EU re-evaluation of large initiatives and regulations, so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all, even as a option/backup. HOWEVER, Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame: retail consumers. Right now, RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout. The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously, but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase. Consumer use is the reason for Impinj's new ""Protected Mode"". Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN. Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone, or Kroger could set PIN(s) for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries' tags at home for pantry inventory, etc. You get the idea.

There's also insights into Impinj's thoughts from press releases on Gen2x, which extends the protocol the tag ICs use:  
""It \[Gen2x\] addresses consumer privacy at point-of-sale.. \[...\] We are today focused on enterprise use cases, but tomorrow’s emphasis will be on consumer use cases, including consumer safety and item sustainability.""  
""Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting, fraudulent returns, or both.""  
""Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers. When necessary, the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN.""  
""Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product’s authenticity using a challenge-response protocol, preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain.""

I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic. Impinj must control that. I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself ('this is a Nike Air shoe, number 123456' for example) but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication ('Impinj indeed made this tag IC, it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database'). So Impinj won't know what the product is (only the brands  ...[truncated]","Impinj DD - RAIN RFID for consumers?

Tags can be little stickers, adhered to paper clothing tags, sewed nearly invisibly into clothing, hidden inside anything non-metallic or non-liquid, etc. Impinj also manufactures expensive stand-alone RFID readers, but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers. I don't have much to say about their readers.

Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICs/chips. Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly. Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10-year agreement to not sue over patents, which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034. David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches. For the next 8 years, Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP.

RAIN RFID is currently used in places like: Walmart, Inditex (clothing), UPS (package tracking, package-on-right-truck verification), Delta and United (baggage tracking), medicine tracking, car tires and other parts, etc. Supply chains and clothing, primarily.

Recent investor calls show they're starting to push food with Kroger. Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets, which may explain their current valuation, which is arguably high. They're starting in the bakery sections now.

Engineering deets you can skip if you're not technical: Tag ICs have been improving in performance, usually about 1-2dB (RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity) per generation / node shrink. This has been essential to the technology's capability and expanded usage. I asked Gemini about next node and it's guessing 20-something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound, which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not get smaller. Impinj knows this. Digital performance/capability/featureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes. Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology. Also, smaller node = more tag ICs per wafer = cheaper tag ICs, so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead. 20-something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not have a premium. Impinj requires cheap wafers.

Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls (do your own reading on this). I know Trump is fucking over US-EU relations and is causing EU re-evaluation of large initiatives and regulations, so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all, even as a option/backup. HOWEVER, Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame: retail consumers. Right now, RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout. The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously, but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase. Consumer use is the reason for Impinj's new ""Protected Mode"". Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN. Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone, or Kroger could set PIN(s) for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries' tags at home for pantry inventory, etc. You get the idea.

There's also insights into Impinj's thoughts from press releases on Gen2x, which extends the protocol the tag ICs use:  
""It \[Gen2x\] addresses consumer privacy at point-of-sale.. \[...\] We are today focused on enterprise use cases, but tomorrow’s emphasis will be on consumer use cases, including consumer safety and item sustainability.""  
""Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting, fraudulent returns, or both.""  
""Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers. When necessary, the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN.""  
""Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product’s authenticity using a challenge-response protocol, preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain.""

I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic. Impinj must control that. I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself ('this is a Nike Air shoe, number 123456' for example) but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication ('Impinj indeed made this tag IC, it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database'). So Impinj won't know what the product is (only the brands  ...[truncated]",25,0.72,14,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qmpwrk/impinj_dd_rain_rfid_for_consumers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qmpwrk/impinj_dd_rain_rfid_for_consumers/,positive,"Positive outlook due to legal win, growth prospects, and expanding consumer use cases."

The US government will receive a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth, a publicly traded Oklahoma-based miner that controls significant US deposits of heavy rare earths, according to people familiar with the matter.

The government investment and a separate $1bn private financing deal are expected to be announced on Monday, according to people familiar with the situation.

One person said the government would get 16.1m shares in USA Rare Earth and warrants for another 17.6m, both at a price of $17.17. The government agreed to pay $277mn for the equity, giving it an implied gain of $490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $24.77.

USA Rare Earth will also receive $1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government. The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022. A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company.

Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “framework” for a deal that could include access to Greenland’s untapped critical mineral wealth. One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland.

USA Rare Earth declined to comment. The commerce department declined to discuss the deal. But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security”.

USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons, to raise more than $1bn in fresh equity financing, the people said. It is not directly related to the deal with the government.

The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration’s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security, including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a so-called golden-share agreement in US Steel.

USA Rare Earth, which has a market value of $3.7bn, is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones, missiles and fighter jets. It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Last year, the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies, including MP Materials, Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas.

Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration. The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements, a rare earths start-up three months after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr’s venture capital group invested in the company.

The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production.

A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $500mn from investors. It is on track to raise more than $1bn because of high demand for the financing deal, which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity, often called a “Pipe”.

Cantor’s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick, one of Trump’s most prominent cabinet members, has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president’s “America first” agenda. Cantor did not play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth.

Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year, helped by a 40 per cent jump this week. The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year.","US to invest $1.6bn into USA rare earths group (USAR) in bid to shore up key minerals

Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing  
Snapchat glasses are releasing this year

IT DOSEN'T MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT, IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN

If the glasses fail he will scraps them, Snapchat will save roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger.

Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible.

One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses.

One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave.

**Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month**  
Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint.

And let’s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing.

“Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.”

Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks.

Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change

Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year

A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. Howev ...[truncated]","SNAPCHAT'S TIME IS HERE

They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing.

“Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.”

Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks.

Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change

Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year

A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping.

and now the part which 99% of you guys wont read:

So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold, and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on.

We are talking about **Altimmune ($ALT)**.

If you’ve been watching the GLP-1 space (Lilly, Novo), you know the ""fat loss"" trade is crowded. But $ALT just pivoted to the holy grail: **MASH (liver disease) + Weight Loss.** And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match.

Here is the DD.

# 1. The Data is absolute fire (FDA Agrees)

The market punished this thing last year because they wanted ""just another weight loss drug."" $ALT gave them something better: **Pemvidutide.**

* **BTD CONFIRMED:** As of Jan 5, 2026, the FDA granted them **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)** for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees ""substantial improvement"" over existing therapies. This is also means chances of approval are now over 75%, FDA wants this drug

**LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS - BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy**

* **The Kicker:** Unlike Madrigal’s drug (Rezdiffra) which just treats the liver, $ALT’s drug shreds fat too. Patients hit **7.5% weight loss at 48 weeks** on the high dose, and the chart showed *no plateau* (meaning they were still losing weight). It’s a two-for-one special: Fix the liver, lose the gut.

# 2. The ""For Sale"" Sign is Blinking

This is the most bullish part. Look at the C-Suite changes. They aren't building a 20-year dynasty; they are dressing the bride for a wedding.

* **New CEO (Jan 2026):** Jerry Durso. Who is he? He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals. **He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma.** He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout.
* **New CFO (Nov 2024):** Greg Weaver. This guy was the CFO at Sirna (sold to Merck) and ILEX (sold to Genzyme).
* **Translation:** You don't hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade.

# 3. Valuation is a Joke (The Value Play)

Let’s look at the comps. This is why it’s the best value on the board.

* **Madrigal ($MDGL):** Multi-Billion market cap. (Commercial stage, but expensive).
* **Viking ($VKTX):** \~$8B+ market cap.
* Novo also got some company in this space for billions
* **Altimmune ($ALT):** **\~$450M - $550M Market Cap.**

It is trading at cash + a handshake. If this gets even *half* the valuation of its peers, it’s a multi-bagger. The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA. The ship is loaded.

# 4. The Catalyst & The Risk

* **The Hype:** The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 2026). Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring.
* **The Risk (The Bear Case):** Cash. They have \~$210M (as of late 2025). Phase 3 is expensive.
   * *Scenario A:* They dilute. Stock dips, we cry, then it recovers.
   * *Scenario B:* Partnership (Non-dilutive cash). Stock moons.
   * *Scenario C:* Buyout. We retire.

# Summary

They have the **Data** (BTD granted), they have the **Management** (literally hired guys who sell companies), and they have the **Market Cap** (insanely low compared to peers).

This isn't a pure obesity play anymore; it's the leading **MASH play** that makes you skinny.

**TL;DR:**

* **Ticker:** $ALT
* **Catalyst:** FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation + Phase 3 start.
* **Upside:** 3-5x to catch up to peer valuations.
* **Risk:** Cash burn/Dilution (unless they partner/sell first).
* **Prediction:** Jerry Durso didn't take this job to work a 9-5. He took it to sign a deal.

Market Cap : 60 Billion

Shares Outstanding : 150million

Reason 1: Ai Data center and robotics

 We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers. The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips, and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them. Everything from Robots, cars, data centers all need memory chips to store data.

Reason 2: Google Search Trends:

Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked, while the share price is making all time highs DAILY. Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green. This NEVER happens to pump and dumps. Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop. look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of. It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks.

I can't post links but just search up ""Google Trends"", type in SNDK and put worldwide, 90 days. 

Reason 3: YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers

Search for SNDK on youtube.

No hyped up videos from streamers, youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000%... I get it, its already up so much. So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up? Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock, thats your cue to sell yesterday. For SNDK, there's none of that so far. 

This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first, before all the retail traders.

Reason 4: Analyst Price Targets

You'll never see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps.

Most updated price targets from investing firms:

Mizuho:  $410 when the stock was only at $300

Bernstein: $580 when it was trading at $350

RBC Capital: $400 when it was at $380

Mizuho: $700Billion in Assets under management

Bernstein: $900Billion in Assets under management

BC Capital: $1 Trillion in Assets under Management.

These are serious predictions, not some guys in a mom's basement

Reason 5: It is TINY compared to other companies

150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector 

Micron (MU) 1.1Billion shares. Market Cap: 380Billion

ASTS: 280 million shares

Nvidia (NVDA) 24 Billion Shares, Market Cap: 4.5T

SNDK? 150million and 60Billion Market cap. Absolutely tiny compared.

Reason 6: Extended Momentum

Just look at the graph, this has been pumping forever. Not 1 or 2 days, Or weeks, or months. its been pumping since IPO.

That is all, good luck

* \-That’s roughly **+$20M per quarter**, or **\~$80M annually**, above expectations
* \-This was a much larger jump than anticipated and strengthens profitability going forward

Pediatric label expansion

* \-Linzess received FDA label expansion for pediatric patients
* \-This makes Linzess the first drug available for this pediatric indication
* \-Expands the addressable market with limited competition
* \-Should further support future sales growth

In Summery

>The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs, adding to the Trump administration’s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S.

>Under the agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $250 billion investment in the U.S., the Commerce Department said. In exchange, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15%, from 20%, and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America. The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week.

>The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China. The Trump administration is attempting to de-escalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S.

>The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC, which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy. They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products.

>TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion, including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan.

>“We’re going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC.

>Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a long-planned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation. Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly, they say.

>TSMC’s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan’s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion. China claims the self-ruled island as its own territory, to be seized by force if necessary.

>China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently, but some analysts say it wouldn’t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC’s production of chips. That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan, they say.

>Under the trade agreement, Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona. The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there.

>TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips.","US Taiwan trade deal cuts tariffs to 15% as TSMC commits $250B and adds Arizona chip plants

>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $56 billion in capital spending for 2026, a stronger-than-anticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom.

>Asia’s most valuable company expects expenditures of $52 billion to $56 billion this year, up at least a quarter from 2025. It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30% in 2026, faster than the average analyst estimate. Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6% to a record in Europe, sending its market value beyond $500 billion.

>The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that’s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators. It’s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending. TSMC — Nvidia’s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout, most notably in the US, to sate future demand.

>“You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst’s question on a conference call. “We’re investing $52 billion to $56 billion in capex, right? If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.”

>Click here for a liveblog on the results.

>TSMC reported NT$505.7 billion ($16 billion) in net income for the December quarter, beating the average estimate. That’s off previously reported sales of $33.1 billion in the period, helping the company surpass $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025.

>Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot. That’s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su, who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again.

>“TSMC’s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.

>The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips, now surpassing $1 trillion in planned expenditures, has helped TSMC achieve more than 30% annual sales growth over the past two years. But it may also hamper some parts of the company’s business.

>An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025, when manufacturers prioritized premium high-bandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips. That’s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices. Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year.

>Hsinchu-based TSMC still relies on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc.’s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business. The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026: Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6%.

>On Thursday, Wei said his company won’t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as high-end smartphones are still selling well.

>TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan. It’s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $165 billion in the US.

>It’s also building plants in Japan and Germany, propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home. Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “close the gap” in supply versus demand.

# Thesis: Crime Scene Investigation

Listen up bozos.

You know what is out of fashion? Competence.

You know what is in fashion? Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $35.

And you know who is letting it happen? Alaska Airlines - they know *all about it* but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart.

This isn't an airline. It is a distressed fintech with planes attached, run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus.

**I am Short Alaska Airlines. Here is the dirt.**

But if your smooth-brains don't want to read or think, just jam this [report](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1YTOzp03oH-S21mcY0ZlbcXdRwcxd9ICq) into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic? It will tell you to short at the double.

# 1. The ""Penalty Box"" Infinite Loop (Tech is F*cked)

In 2022, some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury. It was a last-minute ticket, and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never knew until it was too late. ALK agreed to give his points back as a ""one-time courtesy,"" but then punished the **victim** by permanently banning them from booking online. They have to call a phone line (open 9-5) to use their own points forever.

Fast forward 4 years to 2026.

They haven't fixed a single line of code. It is the exact same robbery. Exact same response. Only now, hackers are running a train on Alaska.

Look at the scoreboard:

370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025.

""370? Who cares?"" you ask, wiping Cheeto dust on your wife's boyfriend's couch.

Listen to me. More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of mile-sniffers. 41 came from a niche Chinese-language chat room (US Card Forum) with only 12,000 weekly visitors.

That is the tip of the iceberg. If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit, the real number across the 12 million normies who don't check their accounts daily is in the **tens of thousands**.

An airline with tech so jacked they can't even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no place in the modern world.

# 2. The ""This is America"" Factor

Now, I'm not a complete moron. I know how this works. Leaking 100,000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats? Ha, this is America. Nobody will care about that. Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up.

But this is more than that.

# 3. The Accounting Riddle

Things gets worse. The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too.

ALK Market Cap: $5.5B. ALK Loyalty Scheme Value: $12B (2024 investor day said so).

Bungle the loyalty scheme, the easiest free money printer you can dream of, and everything goes with it.

Watch how they show the world they have no control of it.

The Q2 2025 Surprise:

ALK suddenly booked a $180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere. No revenue match. Just $180M dropped from the sky.

The Receivables Game:

In the same quarter, their receivables from Bank of America (their credit card daddy) spiked $195M.

Translation: Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no reason. If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand. No explanation so who can say

The Real Puzzle:

By Q3, $120M of that receivable vanished from ""Current Assets"" and wormed its way into ""Other Non-Current Assets.""

Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC won't check the storage locker. Spoiler: They will.

# 4. The Unapprehended Traveler (The Kill Shot)

This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs.

And make the stock rock soon.

Right now - literally today - there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskan's hard-earned miles. So hard-earned that our hero victim actually spotted it! He called up Alaska! *""Hey! There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now!""*

The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk, right? Wait until CBP takes him out back...

**NOPE.**

It doesn't happen. The thief isn't brave; he's safe. **Because Alaska never tells anyone.**

There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster *who was literally in the air*, and Alaska refused.

Why?

Because an arrest creates a Police Report.

A Police Report creates a Public Record.

A Public Record proves a Data Breach.

A Breach crashes the Stock.

They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up.

**Why now:**

* Trump talking about Greenland for rare earth deposits
* China suspended export controls until November 2026. When they come back, this becomes critical infrastructure

* Pre-revenue, burning $10-15M quarterly, $523M cash
* All Buy ratings, average target $23

* Round Top is 70% heavy rare earths. MP is light rare earths. Different products, both needed

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.

In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones part of the SRR contract, which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue.  

Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. 

They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago. 

In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. 

There is also speculation that RedCat’s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its anti-jamming technology. 

They are also tapping in the USV, which I’m sure you’ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones. Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia? Yup. RedCat. 



TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract.

It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search. 

In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact. 

Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out.

If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player.

But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets.

Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, even Sephora. Feels like something will stick.

I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets.

Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, even Sephora. Feels like something will stick.

Yes I know their current P/E of \~10 is fake due to tax reasons.

I also started getting into Options (both buying AND selling them) last year, after learning from you all (and other Reddit forums), to generate income against those shares (because I don't want to/can't practically sell them all at once).

I was (and in some way, still am) a novice when it comes to Options, and needed to learn about DTEs, Delta/Theta etc, by trial and ERROR. I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $$$ all at once.

On Taxes: Did you know that there's something called a ""Millionaire Tax"" surcharge in MA? And that there's a 4% NIIT (Net Investment Income) Tax at the Federal Level at $200k (single)/$300k or more in ""investment"" income?

I also had to LEARN (the HARD way) \*when\* to sell Covered Calls & PUTS, when NOT to, when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS, when you need to just BTC (Buy To Close) a losing Options Trade.

For example, today's losses came from getting ""caught"" in an overnight 10% run-up in RKT last week, after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing, where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet (and then dropped the $200B MBS bombshell afterhours). I knew RKT would get to this range, but I assumed it would get to today's level after Feb/Earnings. Then the tweets happened.....

Half of today's ""Loss"" is from Rolling a couple of CC's up/out, so the loss wasn't that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend (like 2-3x WORSE, before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning). 

Most of RKT's potential is already priced in given the run-up, for now, but I do expect it to be into the high $20's next year, which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $10's range, last year.

**What I think is happening:**

* Trump needs the market to rip into midterms. That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else flows from there.
* Tax cuts, deregulation, defense spending, rate cuts, cash handouts to the base. He needs wins he can point to, and stock market go up is the easiest win there is.
* Meanwhile nobody wants to test him right now. Maduro got snatched. That sent a message. Iran's not going to do anything crazy. Putin's going to wait and see. China's playing nice for the moment.
* That buys a window where risk assets can run.

**Then last night happened:**

* DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed. The actual reason, according to Powell himself, is that Trump wants lower rates.
* Powell posted a video Sunday night. Direct quote: ""The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.""
* He said that. On camera. The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates.
* Gold hit record highs overnight. Dollar sold off. Futures dumped. ""Sell America"" trade came back.
* But by midday stocks had mostly recovered. Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs. Selloff, panic, stabilization, back to business.

**What this means:**

* Short term: volatility. Markets don't like Fed independence being threatened. Chop ahead.
* Medium term: probably bullish? If Trump gets his rate cuts, whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May, that's rocket fuel for stocks. Bad for the dollar, bad for inflation eventually, but good for equities through 2026.
* Long term: this is where it splits into two very different futures.

**Path one, the pump:**

* Trump gets what he wants. Rates come down. Housing unfreezes. Consumer spending picks up.
* Defense budget passes. $1.5T proposed. Counter-drone, AI infrastructure, domestic manufacturing all eat.
* Deregulation everywhere. Crypto rips. Tech rips. Everything rips.
* Market pumps into midterms. People with risk assets do well.

**Path two, the collapse:**

* Trump doesn't stop at pressuring the Fed. He breaks it. Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions.
* ""Sell America"" stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend. Bonds, dollar, and stocks all falling together.
* Or he goes further. Starts taking territory, seizing assets from other countries, because the spending isn't sustainable otherwise. World wants to respond but can't, at first, because US military dominance.
* Internal resistance builds. Coup, paralysis, who knows. Or we stumble into a real conflict. China moves on Taiwan. Russia escalates. Iran miscalculates.
* Everything falls apart.

**Here's the thing though:**

* Even in path two, some stuff still works. Defense doesn't go down during wars. AI infrastructure still matters. Critical minerals become more critical, not less.
* Unless it goes nuclear. Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios.

**Signals I'm watching:**

* Fed independence. If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early, major red flag. Multiple ""Sell America"" days in a row means it's real.
* Defense budget. $1.5T passes, defense names keep working. Stalls or gets blocked, time to reassess.
* Supreme Court on Lisa Cook. Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors. He wins, Fed independence is done.
* Credit card cap. Trump floated 10% today. Banks cratered. If this happens, he's willing to break things for short term juice.
* Foreign treasury holders. China and Japan start dumping in size, that's the real signal.
* Gold. Already at records. Keeps ripping while stocks chop, smart money is positioning for something.

**When I get out:**

* Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days, not hours
* Defense budgets stall
* Bonds, dollar, stocks all falling together for a week plus
* Actual military conflict, not just talk

**Where I'm positioned:**

* Themes: defense, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, domestic semis, some housing
* Mix of shares and longer dated options
* Stuff that wins if Trump pumps, but doesn't completely die if things get ugly

**Bottom line:**

* Bull case: market pumps into midterms, I take profits in 2026
* Bear case: system breaks, but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies
* Worst case: nukes, and nobody cares about stonks anymore

I'm comfortable with those odds.

Paramount Skydance is suing Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav as its latest step in a hostile pursuit to acquire WBD, CEO David Ellison outlined in a letter to WBD shareholders on Monday.

The lawsuit asks a Delaware court to direct Warner Bros. Discovery to provide information about its sale process and pending deal with Netflix.

""WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,"" Ellison said in the letter on Monday.

""We filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer,"" Ellison said.

Ellison also informed WBD shareholders on Monday that Paramount intends to nominate directors for election to WBD's board at the company's 2026 annual meeting, in a move that would add a proxy fight to the equation.

Paramount's latest escalation comes days after WBD's board once again recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's amended offer, which was made in late December. The company has repeatedly said its offer is superior to the company's deal with Netflix and has previously argued that the sale process was unfairly skewed.

A WBD spokesman didn't immediately respond to request for comment Monday.

Warner Bros. Discovery last month agreed to sell its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. The proposed deal was the result of a sale process in which Paramount was bidding for all of WBD's assets, including its portfolio of cable TV channels, known as Discovery Global.

As part of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery plans to separate Discovery Global into its own publicly traded entity.

Soon after WBD reached a deal with Netflix, Paramount went public with its hostile bid. Paramount has offered $30 per share, all cash for all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets.

WBD's board told shareholders in December to reject the initial offer in favor of the Netflix deal, citing concerns about the backing of Ellison's father, billionaire Larry Ellison. Paramount responded with an amended offer in which the Oracle co-founder agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction.

Paramount has stopped short of increasing the size of its bid, however.

The newly merged Paramount Skydance first took interest in Warner Bros. Discovery in the fall, making three unsolicited offers that were each rejected. Warner Bros. Discovery then opened up a sale process seeking offers for some or all of its company.

At the same time, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would carry on with a plan that was announced earlier in the year to split its company into two publicly traded entities — Warner Bros., consisting of the streaming platform HBO Max and film studio, and Discovery Global, comprised of the pay TV networks like TNT and CNN.","Paramount Skydance sues Warner Bros.

Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here.

I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI.

What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity.

By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company.

In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms.

My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat.

This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring.

Here are my supporting theses:

1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.**

* Browser native
* Real-time collaboration
* Design systems 

Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments.

2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.**

At that time: 

* ARR was rougely \~$400M
* Figma was just a design collab tool
* AI wasn’t core to the product story yet 

Fast forward:

* ARR now \~$1B+
* Product suite has expanded massively

That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV.

3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break.

Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. 

Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 

4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process.

One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a ""design to CMS-powered website"" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP.

If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use.

How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 

5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design.

This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter.

6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but:

* What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack 
* What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office
* What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS 

There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. 

The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched.

**Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential.

Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.

I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI.

What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity.

By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company.

In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms.

My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat.

This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring.

Here are my supporting theses:

1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.**

* Browser native
* Real-time collaboration
* Design systems 

Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments.

2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.**

At that time: 

* ARR was rougely \~$400M
* Figma was just a design collab tool
* AI wasn’t core to the product story yet 

Fast forward:

* ARR now \~$1B+
* Product suite has expanded massively

That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV.

3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break.

Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. 

Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 

4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process.

One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a ""design to CMS-powered website"" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP.

If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use.

How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 

5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design.

This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter.

6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but:

* What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack 
* What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office
* What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS 

There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. 

The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched.

**Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential.

Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.

The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through:

• Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth

• Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse

• Rebasing exercises that only ever ""discover"" growth, never decline

• Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals.

When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy.

The first Pillar: Energy Delusion

You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context:

|A|**B**|
|:-|:-|
|Nigeria electricity per capita|**\~140-180 kWh/year**|
|Sub-Saharan Africa average|\~400 kWh/year|
|Brazil (for comparison)|\~3,295 kWh/year|
|Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**|
|Private generator capacity|\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)|

Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated.

Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional.

Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira

|**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**|
|:-|:-|
|CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**|
|YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion|
|Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**|
|Current reserves|\~$45 billion|

They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!)

Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam

Real Estate jumped from 6% to \~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves.

For context:

Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it?

1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values.

2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing

3, Properties counted at ""market rent"" usually don't even have running water or electricity

4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable

They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP.

Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage.

Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game

Every Nigerian GDP rebasing ""discovers"" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up.

|**Rebasing Year**|**GDP ""Explosion""**|**""Discovered"" Sector**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood|
|2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate|

The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better.

Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure.

Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be.

For example:

* \#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents)
* \#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents)

There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information.

I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this:

Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing.

Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way.  ￼

This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security.  ￼

You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real.  ￼

All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes.  ￼

This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed.

That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress.

Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up.

Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.**

It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger:

# BNPL vs Credit Cards

Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything.

If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc.

Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice.

# Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided

A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc.

**Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself.

**Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven.

Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted.

Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s.

# Customer

Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL.

TLDR: Sezzle (SEZL) is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026. \~15 Forward P/E for 2026 w earnings growing \~30%. Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.**

It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger:

# BNPL vs Credit Cards

Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything.

If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc.

Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice.

# Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided

A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc.

**Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself.

**Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven.

Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted.

Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s.

# Customer

Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL.

They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance.

Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally.

That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains.

My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested.

I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era….

The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities.

Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market.

History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday…

Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price.

That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials.

I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure.

That’s the bet.

TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned.

>The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week.

>BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history.

>BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market.

>In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1.

>Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025.

>Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers.

>Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites.

>The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year.

>To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features.

>Aggressive competition

>BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \_\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets.

>Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars.

>BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025.

>While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share.

>From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%.

>Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies.

>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon.

I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened...

The problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism.

I wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me ""the edge"".

[The delivery process](https://i.redd.it/guhgylvldyag1.gif)

I instantly got hit with ""Writers euphoria"", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open.

**If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.**

I will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip.

# Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals

Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer?

It's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly:

1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000

Now let's look at all cancers (this will be important):

± 200 people / 100.000

**.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.**

( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.)

\-----  
Why am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts:

Keytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors).

This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that.  Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission.

So let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed):

USD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M

But wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.**

[Unlocking my full potential](https://i.redd.it/apm2dh6tdyag1.gif)

Keytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower.

Now that we've got over the ""HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS"" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern.

# A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter.

1. The technical guy who actually knows shit
2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day

The first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO.

Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China.

The CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart.

TL;DR:
CPNG only trades in the U.S., but the crisis is entirely in Korea: lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension, the public is actively boycotting, and this is a newly profitable, logistics-heavy business that cannot survive disruption. U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue; Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure.

Coupang is fuk

This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis, not a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today.

At the National Assembly hearing, lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it’s framed in U.S. outlets. Domestically, investigators are disputing Coupang’s disclosures, challenging sworn testimony, and raising perjury accusations. Internationally, it’s still framed as a data breach plus compensation. Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative, and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem.

That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S. The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE. There is no Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage, no local shareholder pressure, and no market release valve. All price discovery happens in the U.S., while all political, regulatory, and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea. Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it.

On the ground, public reaction is not abstract. Lawmakers, civic groups, and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension, not just fines or apologies. Korean media coverage has shifted from “breach response” to “whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form.” At the consumer level, large-scale boycott behavior (“탈팡”) is observable, with app-usage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share. In Korea, boycotts are not symbolic — people actually leave platforms, especially when alternatives exist.

This is existential for Coupang because of its structure. The company only recently became profitable, after years of losses. It is a logistics-heavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume, dense routing, and habit-driven repeat usage. A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability. Drivers leave. Sellers leave. Customers retrain behavior. This is not a business you can pause and restart.

Two weeks ago, Coupang installed a U.S.-trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis. Domestically, that has been widely interpreted as insulating decision-makers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability. That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it.

This is why this trade is no longer about valuation, multiples, or growth trajectories.
It’s about whether a newly profitable, logistics-dependent company — openly boycotted, politically isolated, under criminal scrutiny, and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure.

Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways.

U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle.
Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure.

That disconnect is the thesis.

# 1. Burry’s Thesis

Michael Burry’s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated. Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years ([en.bloomingbit.io](https://en.bloomingbit.io/en/feed/news/100580?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality. Burry estimates this mismatch could total $176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/michael-burry-warns-of-176-billion-depreciation-understatement-by-tech-giants-4346876?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dot-com era ([sahmcapital.com](https://www.sahmcapital.com/news/content/todays-market-focus-the-big-short-returns-to-battle-the-ai-king-nvidia-2025-11-25?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) and is using long-dated puts expiring in 2027 (reddit).

The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real. But Burry may underestimate AMD’s strategic position.

# 2. How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI

NVIDIA’s AI dominance was not planned from day one. CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for general-purpose computing, not AI. Ian Buck, a Stanford CS PhD, experimented with GPUs for non-graphics workloads. His project, Brook, became the foundation for CUDA ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers. Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs, showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Key takeaway: NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company. That “stumble” created their early dominance, but nothing guarantees the next discovery will not favor AMD.

# 3. AMD’s Hardware Readiness

MI300X launched with [192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TB/s bandwidth](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html), giving it a [36% memory advantage over NVIDIA's H200](https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/12/07/amds-horsepower-packed-mi300x-gpu-beats-nvidias-upcoming-h200/) (141GB HBM3e @ 4.8 TB/s). Cost is approximately $10-14k per MI300X versus $40-44k for H200 - roughly one quarter of NVIDIA's price.

[Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and TensorWave deployed 327,000 MI300X units in 2024](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/23/nvidia_ai_hardware_competition/), with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services. This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale, not experimental deployments.

The main constraint is ROCm software maturity. Historical precedent suggests this is temporary - CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance. If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings, AMD's hardware advantage could scale rapidly.

# 4. EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs

AMD has a track record of methodical, generation-over-generation growth in server CPUs:

|Phase|CPU Generation|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Naples|Re-entry into data centers|
|2|Rome|Competitive performance and cost gains attention|
|3|Milan|Default choice for workloads|
|4|Genoa/Turin|Dominant market share|

This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally. The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs.

# 5. The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation

The AI bubble is not bursting. That implies sudden collapse. What I see is a gradual rotation.

* NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales
* Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace
* Refresh cycles could stretch
* Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time

There is no expectation of panic selling. Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold. Burry’s long-dated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash.

# 6. Signals to Watch

* MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300
* Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale
* ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration
* NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions

Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates.

# 7. Bottom Line

* NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company. AMD could be next.
* Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch, but he underestimates AMD's potential impact.
* The AI shift is gradual and structural.
* If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did, MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape.

This analysis is based on research and historical patterns. History is repeating itself, and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA *just like they did with Intel.*","The AI Market: A Gradual Rotation

""I'm tempted to buy some and hold for years but I don't if I'm missing something?""

It's been a volatile stock over the years and you have a lot of concern over the future of gaming given AI headlines recently. Ultimately I think that's a positive for TTWO and its IP if production can be done more cheaply in the coming years - more DLCs, etc.

Elsewhere in gaming, you have Ubisoft looking like it's a 0 and I certainly don't think the ATVI purchase by MSFT has gone as hoped.  EA has been bought and is waiting for that deal to go through. 

There are also times when a lot of people are trying to de-risk at once and you're currently seeing that. It's not always necessarily about the stock you own, it's about a lot of people suddenly going ""get me out of these growth stocks now."" You also are going to have days where growth gets sold off and if it gets sold off enough, stocks with great fundamentals are often not going to avoid that kind of selling.

I think TTWO is a good opportunity under $200, but this could continue to be the kind of market where it continues to sell and someone interested could DCA.

I literally never use Google search anymore (or DDG or whatever) - I just use ChatGPT and get MUCH better results. No ads or sponsored links filling the page (yet).

Apple tried and failed embarrassingly at even getting an LLM out. Their AI org is an absolute mess that has done nothing but bleed talent. Apple is not sitting this out by choice.

> They likely plan to take the assets out of compute intense workloads and use them in DC for things like pilot light DR or lower tier workloads.

But that's not what's happening. Google doesn't have the datacenter  capacity to continue running their older TPUs and deploy new ones, and the lead times to build new datacenters/energy capacity is much longer than the life of these products.

Depreciation expense thing is real: https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/31/alphabet_q4_2023/

Immediate expensing of R&D thing is also real: https://www.adamsbrowncpa.com/blog/rd-expenditures/#:~:text=Immediate%20Expensing%20for%20Domestic%20R%26D,over%20at%20least%2060%20months.

Google is using 6 years for depreciation periods of hardware, yet they pull their TPUs out of service after 2-3 to replace them with the latest TPUs, due to lack of capacity to run both. They then don't write them off because in theory they can plug them back in once they build more capacity, but they likely don't plan to.

This is entirely legal and valid under GAAP, but it misleads investors.

Yeah lily has been pretty hot.   hopefully it's a short cool down.  It could be the big fish shaking out liquidity. 

 What's weird to me is with Google and meta still saying they're going to spend a metric boatload of money on AI infrastructure, why are all the AI infrastructure stocks down?

Their 30% growth is more because of accounting manipulation and corporate tax cuts than actual underlying performance:

- Updating the depreciation period of their compute hardware from 2-3 years to 6 years massively inflated earnings by hiding depreciation expense. This change was unjustified considering AI hardware becomes outdated after 2-3 years.

- The restoration of immediate expensing of R&D and Capex significantly reduced tax expense

Google's free cash flow, a better measure of performance, has been in a slight decline.

Google is in the best position to win it all in the AI war. Apple already cashed in their chips and chose Google for AI. That alone is massive. Google also have the longest and best track record with machine learning.

Oh and don’t forget Waymo is far ahead in autonomous driving.

It's do or die for google. After dominating search market for 2 decades they have got the first real competitor in the form of openAI. If they don't spend and innovate Google will be obselete. Unlike Google, Apple still don't have a proper competitor that's why they are not worried much about AI

>Yet, still you post, because you have some level of confidence in US treasuries right? The same is true with me for Google.

The only real way to lose money in USD nominal terms, on T Bills is if the US treasury defaults on its obligations and remains in default. If this happens, it would trigger a global financial collapse that would almost certainly take Google down with it.

If you are a foreign investor(ie Europe) then its a bit different, because there is FX risk with holding US treasury bills.

I think market in general is gonna fall at least another 10%.  Google isn't special.  Even with 10% drop valuations are still way out of range, so could go more...maybe 20%

Not really. Google just wants to suffocate all of its AI competition.

Yeah the russell was looking way better this morning.  But so was micron and wdc.

At this point I'm like half ported in chips and ai anyway. I don't really have a choice but to hold.  I will DCA probably end of day or tomorrow.  Honestly feels like the tech software sell off spooked everyone and now they're just sitting on the sidelines like you said.  Still can't see why Google would dip on great earnings.

I'm holding GOOGL because they seem to be one of the few companies who understand how to monetize AI.  Their earnings reflect that and I think the investments they are making in AI are well thought out with an eye towards fiduciary duty to the shareholders.

There are a lot of other companies that are burning through cash and I don't think they've done much homework on how they intend to actually profit off those investments.  Google has done that homework.

Google has the upper hand with integrated AI through its Google Workplace. It will rise eventually.

Yep. Same with Microsoft as well.

Winner of this AI race seems to be Apple. Without spending a dime lol. They are like suckers go spend whatever and then we will see ya 4 years later.

You're right. I had checked earlier and it was up. But yes, wondering if big money is just sitting on the side lines waiting for everything to shake out. I'm in pretty deep on NBIS, AMD, GOOG and NVDA, and don't really feel like selling and realizing a bunch of losses so I'm in it for the long haul. 

Realistically, if you believe that the stocks will be higher in 6 months than they are today, it'd be foolish to liquidate.

I have upped my investment in Amazon and Microsoft, which at this time are bounded by negative sentiments.

Its in same situation as Google, and Microsoft and Amazon will come stronger, so doing average down kn these 2 stocks.

If Google fall massively, then will think of buying more, at this point don't wanna rush up.

Before the bitcoin etfs it was a way to get exposure in accounts that could only hold listed products (like a reg T account or IRA).

Google is down because they are expecting to DOUBLE their spending this year.  They want to invest in AI and cloud hardware. Thus TSMC is up. 
Hold steady, unless you’re a short player.

It’s for people that know they have 0 ability or knowledge to buy and store bitcoin in a wallet and secure it forever. They have no interest in becoming the next guy who spends years trying to find his old computer in an active landfill

No he’s asking why Google went down. Can you guys read?

Id say its the top of useless stock companies. Maybe it has something todo with epstein and ms window being compromised. Maybe ai is usefull but the valuation is super high.

What does silver and bitcoin have to do with the real economy?

Maybe. They will 100% try to rig or strongarm the election. Only uncertainty is whether they will succeed or if enough people will turn out.

did trump said something or plan to say something to stress out market again? i am pretty sure is trump again. dont forget to say thank you to russia asset trump

Umm it's not expectations not being met. Googles report was honestly insane. There is nothing not remarkable about their earnings. The only concern is capex spend. Same with Meta honestly.

But even the places they are spending, didn't go up so it's just a sell off and manipulation for now. We will randomly rip at some point once retail is thoroughly shook.

Why would anyone ever hold a stock whose entire purpose is to dilute in order to buy more bitcoin?  Just own the bitcoin if you’re so inclined!

Silver crashing and bitcoin crashing are simply whales selling.

> bloated AI hype stocks with no earnings

Of which stocks do you speak? PLTR? Anyone else?

There is, its the probable appointment of Kevin Warsh who is careful with doing QE. The market didnt expect that.

Thats why BTC and risk assets are sold off, but dividend ETFs make new highs.

I think this is the heart of the OP question.  Are the sellers seeing something that others don't.  Is there something going on we should be aware of

No! It’s supposed to go down don’t you see! Spending on salaries, construction, hardware, software and various overhead is actually super bad for the economy! GOOG should only do buybacks! Also AI simultaneously isn’t real but will kill the largest software enterprise companies! 

Buy bullets the end is nigh

TSM, MU, AVGO, NVDA all green currently.  Hard to ignore those massive capex numbers by Microsoft and Google.

They change the dosage and then it's not FDA approved and not technically the same medication. They may also combine the medication with something else.

Because the costs of ai in capital, resource and social drain it’s bringing.  We’re talking about something that is costing BILLIONS of dollars, it’s also an extreme drain of resources from data centers with both electrical and water demands, or the skyrocketing prices if chips and ram.  And any threat to society with job loss is rarely going to be welcomed with open arms except by c suites and Wall Street.  Ai is so insanely expensive

I bought a couple more google and may buy some more sls and drts by end of day. My other holdings are basically just nbis, mu, and etfs so just need to not open vanguard for at least a month after this lol

>But a lot of people seem to think it’s going to eat away every single job, especially when you consider improvements to robotics lately. That’s where my criticism lies.

I actually think it's more of an excuse for letting people go than anything else. Using Gemini 3 Pro has been a lot of fun, but my best use cases right now are starter code and meme-making. Not exactly living up the standards set by Google many years ago.

I think Bitcoin is finished in terms of it returning anything meaningful. You’re better off buying index funds in my opinion. Flat returns from Bitcoin would absolutely destroy MSTR.

same pattern he uses to manipulate everything for his corruption scheme. tomorrow after markets or saturday hell announce something to pump early next week or some new threats

GOOG is becoming one of my largest holdings

fuck me. The feeling when you buy something that ALREADY collapsed, stabilized, then it nosedives more ten minutes after you buy it

Trades are nowhere near as available as they are made out to be. This is especially true in more standardized trades like electrical and plumbing. Welding is hard as hell to find. Like sure, if you can find someone to train you to be a boilerman or something obscure you're probably good. But it's not the cakewalk to money like it was 10 years ago.

Have you seen what first responders make? That shit got fucked by private equity. It's hardly a career at this point.

Healthcare is getting absolutely buttfucked by the current administration. Medicare cuts and nursing losing its career status are costing jobs like crazy.

Remember this all started with btc over the weekend. The coin boys owe us all these loses and then some

Agreed. That’s my fear is that these are still quality companies but losing some of the premium. 

Also sounds dumb, but a lot don’t pay dividends. When there is fear in the market, it at least gives the investor something.

>Enough BTC on the balance sheet to pay dividends for 50+ years. 

Only if bitcoin is still in decent price when the bonds mature

Why are people so doomer on AI?

Jobs were always at risk of being automated. In my first job out of college, my team and I worked to automate as much as possible, such as tedious data entry or routine tasks. 

I think we sent way too many kids to college over the past few decades and are now realizing we have more white collar employees than we really need. 

Meanwhile trades jobs, first responder jobs, and healthcare jobs are going unfilled. 

Shouldn’t we try to automate the drudgery? Like if I lost my job, I’d retrain for something else. You guys all sound like people from 200 years ago saying looms were bad because it would put weavers out of work. There’s always work available if you go to where the demand is. Not everyone needs to have a white collar job.

Honestly Google just needs to move its earnings report date. Each and every quarter they are getting shat on from bad reports of previous tech companies. It's almost comically precise at this point

Bonds on average are due in four years. Earliest in over a year. USD reserves can pay dividends for multiple years. Enough BTC on the balance sheet to pay dividends for 50+ years. 

MSTR is amplified bitcoin. If BTC is down 10%, it’d be weird if it wasn’t down 20%. It’s performing as designed. 

Unless you think BTC is dead, it’s not going anywhere. 

Edit: a word

wow. From 29% YTD to -4% YTD in exactly 3 weeks,

High beta giveth and high beta taketh.

Google is falling victim to the same issue that is bringing down other big tech like MSFT, Meta, etc. Apple is not spending a huge amount on capex, so those two are not the same.

as long as other sectors down together with tech, I am justified.❤️

GOOGL is up over 60% in the past 6 months, what is there to bounce back from?

I guess I just thought there would've been a more straight forward catalyst. PLTR and Tesla still up like crazy so we'll see if this is just the start

Everyone knew PLTR was overvalued. Few were actually shorting it.

Depends on two things imo. How much revenue they take in from their actual software business (and I think they are lying about this) and how many more / what appetite investors have for their ATM issues. The whole scam hinges on Strategy raising cash to pay bond interest. That's it, it doesn't really matter that the underlying asset is BTC. It's not good that it's BTC lol. But the cash comes from ATM issue of MSTR stock.

I'm not sure if I'd want to use TSLA as my comparison for an investment.

GOOGL will eventually bounce back like APPL did. The earnings just came out at a bad time when all tech is being sold off. GOOGL is actually a safe haven play right now and we'll see that rotation in the next couple of weeks.

I get that but the report only solidified the bullish speculative narrative and shit like Tesla has been in lalaland for years.

I wish Robinhood rolled out short selling when TSLA was approaching $500.

Michael Burry gets a lot of shit, but he was right.

PLTR down 30-40% since he bought his puts. NVDA down slightly as well (unfortunately).

Crypto tanking and indeed causing overleveraged auto-liquidation with contagion spreading to other risk assets.

Live right now, Scott Bessent is lying his face off under oath.  He’s claiming Trump lowered grocery prices and that any prices that are higher now than a year ago are Biden’s fault.  

Elizabeth Warren corrected him with factual numbers from their own BLS.

Yet useless CNN is running these two headlines about the exchange:  

* “Bessent: Grocery Prices coming down under Trump”
* “Bessent: Any affordability issues were caused by Biden”

And of course, no headline about Elizabeth Warren fact checking this sleaze.

PLTR selling like crazy from that report. I'm not smart enough to know what's going on, does it have to do with the SaaS sell off? AI bubble fears?

Is VIX up today solely because of the backsliding in equities or is something else going on?

And yet both Google and Microsoft and Amazon are all getting absolutely ass blasted.

JNJ being my best performer is something.

Let's start from the $310 price it was in 2021. There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high. That puts PayPal close to a $300B valuation with $4B net income. It was trading for 80X earnings.

Let's talk about the positives:  
\#1. PayPal Bans - Have you heard those stories? People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage. What does this truly mean? This means most of it's revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention. 

\#2. Mark Grether - **PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026. I'm getting emails.** The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform. However, PayPal made a huge mistake here not making this the main focus. Who is Mark? Well, in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon. Amazon then took it's ad unit from $10B to $30B in revenue. Uber hired Mark. In 2022 to 2024, Mark took Uber's ad business to $0 to $1B in revenue.

What is PayPals Ad Manager? Let's act as if this was my own website. My post will get thousands of clicks but no monetization. Now, with PayPal ads, I can integrate their SDK into my website, and within minutes start running ads on this post. (Not this actual post but if it was my site)

This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars. For example, if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $2B revenue at 50% margins, they would go from $5-6B net income, to $6-7B net income, and slowly go higher overtime. This is the setup the stock needs to go $100+

\#3. PayPal Integrations - People seem to forget, PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal. This means users/businesses all get free advertising to PayPal. No matter what, naturally PayPal will grow for the next 5-10 years. Does it need more social growth? People choosing to actually want it? Yes. As an online business, if I'm not accepting PayPal I'm at a huge disadvantage. People use PayPal for their chargeback protection. I'm confident anytime I buy with PayPal I'm protected. 

Side Note: PayPal's and Venmo's cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet.

**The moat remains in ads. PayPal's entire focus needs to shift to running ads.** 

**Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years, to sell now, ask yourself, why? PayPal ads release in early 2026. This is the product that will drive growth. We haven't even seen it yet.**","Why everyone has PYPL wrong and the hidden untapped value in PayPal

They make electrical distribution equipment - transformers, switchgear, PDUs, power skids, the stuff that moves electricity from the grid to your servers. Not sexy but completely essential. Every data center, every utility substation, every big manufacturing plant needs this stuff.

FY25 revenue: $753M (up 56% YoY)
Adjusted EBITDA: $169M (22.5% margin)
Adjusted net income: $88.7M
Backlog: $1.03B as of Sept 2025

Q1 FY26 came in at $283M revenue which is 84% growth. The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility. One thing I noticed - they lead with adjusted figures everywhere. GAAP net income isn't prominently disclosed which usually means there's a meaningful gap. They're adjusting out amortization from acquisitions, sponsor fees, integration costs, stock comp, etc. The adjustments are defensible given the situation but I'd like to see full GAAP figures. 

This is a PE roll-up. Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024:

MGM Transformer (Oct 2023)
PwrQ (March 2024)
States Manufacturing (May 2024)
VanTran (June 2024)

So they've been operating as a combined entity for less than two years. 

Revenue breakdown:
Data centers: 42%
Grid/utilities: 23%
Industrial: 19%
Other: 16%

By product type:
Custom/engineered-to-order: 91%
Standard products: 5%
Services: 4%

The custom work is where the margins are. They're not competing on price with commodity stuff.

Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this, their largest comparable and another power infra company. He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv. That's probably the most relevant experience you could ask for - he's literally done this before with a similar business. CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment ($12B+ in revenue). So the management bench is legitimately experienced.

As mentioned above, Vertiv is the big dog in data center power/cooling infrastructure, currently trading around $135 with a $50B+ market cap.


Pros: 
* AI buildout, grid modernization, manufacturing reshoring - all of this requires electrical equipment
* Supply constrained market. Lead times for this stuff can be 2-4 years from some suppliers. Forgent   claims their lead times are 30-65% shorter than industry average
* Capacity expansion almost done. They've invested $205M to expand manufacturing, should support up to $5B in revenue without major additional capex
* Management knows the space

Cons:
* This is a PE exit. 70% of the IPO is secondary (existing shareholders cashing out). Only 30% is primary shares with proceeds going to the company. Neos wants liquidity.
* Roll-up risk. Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity. Less than 2 years of operating history together.
* Valuation is rich for what's essentially a bet that the pieces fit together
* Data center exposure cuts both ways. If AI capex slows down they're exposed.","Upcoming IPO No one is talking about: Forgent Power (FPS) 2/5/26

I think it's safe to say that that whole 'SaaS extinction event' narrative has basically gone from 'scary idea' to 'accepted wisdom' by the market at this point given the magnitude of the moves today after Anthropic dropped their latest tool and everyone freaked out. I'm not saying that's right, the markets frequently get it wrong, just commenting on the price moves.

I'm trying to figure out what to do here.

Option A would be begin to buy these SaaS companies that have large customer bases, recurring revenue and a long history. Doing that sort of requires a belief that they'll integrate AI into their products 'on the run' while fending of the 'pure' AI companies and their abilities. They might fall more in the next months / years so doing this also would require a fair bit of patience and ability to tolerate that pain.

Option B would be to not buy at all, continue to watch as the market sorts out the winners and losers. This would be based on a belief that AI is actually going to cause most of these companies to either lose a bunch of users or that it will compress their margins so far that they'll become unattractive investments but that it's impossible to tell which at this point.

Option C would be to wait on the 'AI bubble' popping because if that happens, all tech will be indiscriminately sold down (whether it's AI or SaaS) for a while. Doing that means a belief that the AI capabilities of the AI companies are overstated and that the SaaS companies will be fine in the long term as they integrate the helpful AI tools and keep their users. I have no idea on whether that's true or not (and no one else really seems to either, but the moves today seem to suggest there's more in the 'AI will change everything' camp than the 'AI is a bubble one').

Edit: Woah, this has blown up and there's some insanely good takes in the comments from people actually in the industry and stuff. I might expand the post and then incorporate the best of the feedback and format it properly then post the whole deep dive to my profile (probs too long for a sub post) so feel free to follow there if you want to see it.","SaaS Extinction Event or Buy Level?

Would it be smart to add around 4000 to nvidia, prior to the earnings. I’m 24 with 52,900 invested into index funds, and a long term time horizon. Or should I start putting money into google, given its future potential, and recent run up.

I think you are right in considering competitive risks and Google is better protected since they are diversified.  With that said Nvidia wins awards on innovation.  


Getting squeezed out like Intel did due to not shifting to new markets quickly enough is a very real risk, but I think Nividia gets a nod that their management team set them up to make bank on the current environment.  


Secondly, Google is a main customer of Nvidia in their cloud computing. CUDA is so pervasive that they can not get away from Nvdia. Of course to your point cloud computing could be an entirely different beast in a number of years.


I am with the opinion they are both well suited for long term and if one is picking individual stocks they should probably have both and rebalance annually to adjust for market changes.


Thanks for the discussion and points you made.

I just personally think Nvidia is too risky, because their only moat is GPU. Which means maybe TPU will take over the world and Nvidia is fucked. It may not happen, but it also might happen.

Google is different, if search is fucked, then what? They have waymo, YouTube, cloud, which will still grow. If cloud is fucked, then what? They still have everything else. If quantum doesn't work out, well that's just an experiment for them. I don't see a future where all these product fail simultaneously and doesn't allow Google to pivot.

That's the reason mainly. Another reason is if Google actually dominate the AI market.

However, if it does happen, it will be a hard time for all. The Fed was late to hike rates back in 2022 when inflation was rising. During that time, despite CPI being at 5%, they said inflation was transitory. The full effects of rate changes, from one extreme to another, take an awful long time to see their full effects. Fed funds were cut to 0% in April of 2020. They did not realize inflation was a problem until 2022, almost a year and a half later. During this time, the stock market had ripped 115% from the COVID lows, people were buying houses before seeing them, and offering 50-100k over asking. NFT's and the metaverse became a big thing as well, which, as it turned out, was absolutely garbage. Stocks like RIVN, GME, and AMC became hyperbolic. Yes, the Ukraine invasion and the consequent block of Russia added to the cause. I will address this a bit further down. There was a bubble.

Supply will rush, causing higher supply and lower prices. AI is another plausible accelerator to lowering service costs. 

The fact is that inflation has already been lowered, from 9% to 2-3%. Any lessening of cutting rates, combined with supreme court's decision, will unleash a fury of chaos. 

As the regime shifts, gold and silver coming down might be the first sign of this. Deflation is the lowering of prices; gold and silver's prices are lower in past few trading days. Historically, gold had performed well during deflationary cycles; however, that is in the past. Gold was used as a means of wealth. The main question is, just like bitcoin, is gold a shiny object syndrome? Food for thought.

The left tail is always fat. Per Powell, the tail is always fatter than what you think it is. I think there is a conversation to have about deflation. I also think that there is a probability of resurgence of inflation (tariffs working through the supply chain + the lack of data due to government shut down (mostly shelter)).","Fat and Far Left Tail - Deflation?

Spot gold fell nearly 10% on Friday, while silver saw an even steeper drop of around 30%, marking one of its biggest short-term moves in years. The continued weakness suggests that last week’s rout wasn’t just a one-day event. Some of the pressure appears to be coming from profit-taking after a strong run earlier this year, along with shifting expectations around interest rates and the U.S. dollar. When yields move higher and the dollar strengthens, precious metals often struggle. Silver’s move stands out in particular, given its dual role as both a precious metal and an industrial input. That makes it more sensitive to changes in growth expectations and broader risk sentiment. For now, it looks like traders are reassessing positioning in metals after a crowded rally. Curious how others here are viewing this  temporary shakeout, or something more structural?

The silver crash especially stood out to me. It felt less like fundamentals breaking and more like forced selling and leverage getting unwound. CME margin increase mandate was the main reason. So, big guys messed up and now this shutdown again.

Because of that, I’m leaning toward more correction and chop, similar to what we saw around the November shutdown. I’m not rushing to buy the first bounce. If anything, I’ll be watching for another flush and looking at quality names or assets that were sold for liquidity rather than because something actually broke.

What’s everyone’s take on Monday’s market after Friday’s selloff? The silver crash especially stood out to me. It felt less like fundamentals breaking and more like forced selling and leverage getting unwound. CME margin increase mandate was the main reason. So, big guys messed up and now this shutdown again.

Because of that, I’m leaning toward more correction and chop, similar to what we saw around the November shutdown. I’m not rushing to buy the first bounce. If anything, I’ll be watching for another flush and looking at quality names or assets that were sold for liquidity rather than because something actually broke. Curious if others are expecting continuation lower or stabilization next week.

In the clearest sign yet that Tesla is pivoting away from its electric car business, its CEO, [Elon Musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk), announced on Wednesday’s investor call that the company would discontinue production of its Model X SUV and Model S full-size sedan.

“It’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end,” Musk said. “We expect to wind down S and X production next quarter.”

The model S and X factory in Fremont, California, would be converted to produce Tesla’s upcoming Optimus robot, Musk said.

The question is: Is the market ready for it? 

And is this a strategic move planned for sometime, or a pivot necessitated by plummeting Tesla EV sales?

So what's new?

**Key points:**

\- Fed Chairman Warsh appointment: President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday. He is a known hawk; his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort, tending toward short-term interest rate drops while maintaining long-term raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric.

\- Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday, January 28, stating the U.S. is not planning to intervene, indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis.

\- The Yen reached a critical low point this week, testing the 158-159 range (closing Friday at 154.73). Any further drops become an un-ignorable domestic cost of living issue, and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160.

\- Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5% (down from 2.0%), virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate intervention, as rates remain pinned at 0.75%.

\- US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0% line (the 30-year ended Friday at 4.87%), a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse.

\- Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent; the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday, February 2, with auctions to follow.

**The crossroads?**

The carry trade needs to unwind, as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward, whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward. However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse.

**Avenues?**

A. The Fed could print USD to buy Yen, however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood, with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese.

B. The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen, however recent economic figures (1.5% CPI) rule this out as a short-term possibility, and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind.

C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency, via deploying USD cash reserves of \~$160.4 Billion (held as deposits at the Fed), or selling T-bills/notes/bonds from their $1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen.

As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now, leaving the most viable being option C.

However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages.

A T-bill (short-term), T-note and bond (long term) sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows, and send US Bond yields soaring, sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse, particular in longer term treasuries. Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets, spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance.

This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings, crypto typically first, high risk stocks, and then precious metals (as seen in Friday's sharp gold sell-off).

As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic, even for gold and silver, is seldom a good bet. Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail, as cash (USD/EUR/YEN) currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle. I suspect metals will find a floor, however commodities are not my turf so I'll let others do the deeper commentary there.

**The remaining option?**

There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover.

The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF, strengthening the Yen, triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short positions, and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned, whilst also not crushing the carry trade.

Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed, the carry trade is not crushed and can slowly unwind, and global stock markets grind on higher.

However what happens next remains to be seen, and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Q4 2025 net income = $38.95 million

Increase = 17.56m (profitable!)

So why the shift? Webull has been spending heavily on infrastructure and global expansion. They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling  hourlies on the spx index. It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly - with more features than many desktop apps can dream of.
Ai assistant was implemented.

Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement. But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story. Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly, within same year they spent the money! 

2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year, and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement, it seems all sunshine and rainbows.

But the stock itself is telling a different story - reaching new lows day after day. Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and ""chinese ownership"" as a problem. In other words, fud is churning, retail is selling (per robinhood stat) and hedge funds are.. buying? Thats right, hedge funds are aggressively adding right now.

At the same time, short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25!

Furthermore, the stock is massively overleveraged. The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for - thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares. The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper.

But this is very unlikely to happen.

So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding, seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later, and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin.

And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5% hit.

So what does the future hold for webull?

 *concentrates* 

An intense warzone between fundamentals, fud, and manipulators. Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon (tesla) but.. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast? Could it be that... we see inverse tesla, and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share?

The answer is.. yes.

Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma, hedge funds, and fud are king. Fundamentals have not played a part in a long time. An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion. Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift.","Webull - No one reads quarterlies anymore?

But the stock itself is telling a different story - reaching new lows day after day. Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and ""chinese ownership"" as a problem. In other words, fud is churning, retail is selling (per robinhood stat) and hedge funds are.. buying? Thats right, hedge funds are aggressively adding right now.

At the same time, short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25!

Furthermore, the stock is massively overleveraged. The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for - thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares. The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper.

But this is very unlikely to happen.

So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding, seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later, and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin.

And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5% hit.

So what does the future hold for webull?

 *concentrates* 

An intense warzone between fundamentals, fud, and manipulators. Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon (tesla) but.. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast? Could it be that... we see inverse tesla, and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share?

The answer is.. yes.

Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma, hedge funds, and fud are king. Fundamentals have not played a part in a long time. An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion. Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift.",15,0.74,15,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qqu6d2/webull_no_one_reads_quarterlies_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qqu6d2/webull_no_one_reads_quarterlies_anymore/,error,Invalid sentiment: positive|negative|neutral

Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups. These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears, but each has concrete near-term pops from production ramps, restructurings, or demand surges.

Rivian (RIVN) trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears. It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales, way below Tesla. The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal, Illinois, with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June. Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026, pushing toward breakeven margins. Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and off-road focus that Tesla’s Cybertruck hasn’t fully nailed yet, plus locked-in supplier costs for higher-volume profitability.

FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73% drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America. P/E at 4 times looks dirt cheap, 96% below peers, with earnings growth projected over 50%. Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring (shifting production to lower-cost spots) drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026. The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully, and new direct-sales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control.

Fluor (FLR) around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82% reimbursable backlog to cut risk. GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026, plus SMR work. The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales, unlocking cash for buybacks. Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energy/infra projects, and long-term engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this.

Ciena (CIEN) at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times, 30% discount to sector. Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs. EPS upgrades run strong (15 up, zero down recently), and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion, up about 24% at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog. The moat strengthens as the “nervous system” for AI clusters with high-capacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites, where competitors lag on speed and low-latency scale.

L3Harris (LHX) around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spin-off. The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026, creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core. This unlocks value in higher-margin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyber/space. Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale (from Aerojet acquisition) that’s hard to replicate fast, plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp.

Big gains today (30%ish?).  But if you bought in when I made that post you would be up 60%.  BUT, this is just the beginning.

What happened today is something I felt would happen - they spun off their auto OEM to focus Modine on data centers and edge computing.  To say this company will be huge is an UNDERSTATEMENT.  Read everything I wrote in that post - it will all happen.

Here's how it'll play out:

MSFT and Meta will continue spending on capex -> MOD goes up.

CES 2026 companies building edge businesses -> MOD goes up.

Autonomous driving/robotics continues to grow -> MOD goes up.

There is a reason they split the Auto OEM off - it's low growth.  MOD is now a high growth company focusing on cooling products that are generating insane amounts of heat.

To everyone who read and ACTED on [my rant on Modine Manufacturing](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q6s8t3/modine_manufacturing_is_being_sold_off_due_to/), you're in luck.  Big gains today (30%ish?).  But if you bought in when I made that post you would be up 60%.  BUT, this is just the beginning.

What happened today is something I felt would happen - they spun off their auto OEM to focus Modine on data centers and edge computing.  To say this company will be huge is an UNDERSTATEMENT.  Read everything I wrote in that post - it will all happen.

Here's how it'll play out:

MSFT and Meta will continue spending on capex -> MOD goes up.

CES 2026 companies building edge businesses -> MOD goes up.

Autonomous driving/robotics continues to grow -> MOD goes up.

There is a reason they split the Auto OEM off - it's low growth.  MOD is now a high growth company focusing on cooling products that are generating insane amounts of heat.  There are competitors, but the demand is insatiable and their backlog expands 18 months!  Earnings are on the 4th of next week.  Buckle up!

Look at **Metals/Conductors** (Copper, Gold, Silver)? RIPPING. We are digging shiny rocks out of the ground like dwarves on meth. This is the BLOOD. The flow. The path of least resistance.

We need **RESISTANCE.** We need to stop the current from grounding out so we can trap the energy (tendies) inside the portfolio forever.

**THE PLAY: ISOLATOR STOCKS**

I am talking about the boring, dusty companies that make the pink stuff in your walls and the ceramic disks on power lines.

1. **Owens Corning (OC):** They make fiberglass. PINK FIBERGLASS. It’s basically cotton candy that makes you itch and stops money from leaving your house.

UK restructuring is not that. It is a different legal path. Different incentives. Different timeline. Equity does not automatically go to zero. Preferred equity will be issued but that does not immediately dilute the stock, meaning shorts are caught in a squeeze

Wall Street analysts predicted Nvidia would continue to dominate the global AI market with over 95% market share, and that China had ‘no choice’ but to accept Washington’s terms.

Reality turned out very differently.

On January 13, 2026, the Trump administration, after months of hardline sanctions, reversed course and allowed Nvidia to export H200 chips to China under a series of conditions: third-party inspections, a cap limiting China to at most 50% of the volume sold to the U.S., a ban on military use, and an additional 25% surcharge collected by the U.S. government.

But just one day later (January 14), Chinese customs announced a suspension of H200 imports, leaving thousands of Nvidia’s expensive chips stuck at ports.

This ‘drama’ was not random.

It is a lesson Washington is now being forced to learn the hard way: the more sanctions intensify, the more determined China becomes to achieve self-reliance. And they are making progress

Liu Ying, a researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, made a remark that has forced Western analysts to rethink: ‘Looking back, the tariffs imposed by the United States on countries like China have actually promoted the diversification of our international trade and international cooperation, and have become a driving force behind China’s technological independence.’

China’s trade with ASEAN has surged, surpassing the U.S. to become its largest trading partner. Trade with the EU and with Belt and Road countries has seen double-digit growth. Trade with the U.S. has fallen by nearly 20%, yet China’s GDP still grew 5.2% in 2025.

In semiconductors, this ‘catalyst effect’ is even more obvious. In 2024, Nvidia held 66% of China’s AI chip market. By early 2026, according to Bernstein forecasts, that share is expected to collapse to just 8%, while domestic Chinese firms (Huawei, Cambricon, Moore Threads, Iluvatar CoreX, etc.) are projected to take roughly 80% of the market.

Zhang Jianzhong, CEO of Moore Threads, said confidently at the Huashan product launch: ‘Our new products meet the needs of domestic developers. There will be no need to wait for advanced foreign products anymore.’

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

wouldnt that mean the market will keep on rising and everyone makes money?

ased on recent news, my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is:

(a) US Navy build-out given that China ship-building capacity vastly out-strips the the US at this point, and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world (note, this was the reason Venezuela mattered...Panama isthmus... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters.

(b) Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle, where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad.

So bottom line is - US is completely dominant in Space, Missiles, and Air - but sea is more dicey than anything else. I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive.

So back to OII...compare is to OIH (oil services companies) and it trades basically in tandem with that. It also has an oil services multiple of \~1x ev / sales and 5x ev / ebidtda.

Now to the interesting part: The March DoD Contract.

In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company’s history. The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense. Note, this is a serious company, they make about 3b in rev a year. They don't play any games. In other words, there is no reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders. In Q1 2025, they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract.

Bottom line, the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor (a ""part-maker"") to the lead company managing an entire military program - in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend.

What's this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play? What are the comps here? Well, right now the only decent comp is Kraken. Which is now a 2b ev off of \~20m in quarterly rev. Again OII is only 3b ev against \~750m in quarterly revenue. Kraken is looking a 27x / sales vs 1x sales for OII. I am not here to talk shit about Kraken. I think the company is great and could continue to rip.

My point is simply this - the market is very, very thirsty for subsea military tech. So thirsty, they seem to form cults around them.

This brings me to my other major points - the S Korean retail interest. From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts.. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on. He rarely pitches new names, and when he does people sit up and listen. In this case, the OII post got about \~200k views and very enthusiastic responses.

After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum, my general heuristic is - when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible.

In sum, if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda, this would would be 3x on the commons...which given the modest IV would translate to \~20x on a many of the strikes.

And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations - which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to, this could be bar none the trade of the year.

The share purchase was related to xAI’s $20 billion financing round announced earlier this month. The artificial intelligence startup is best known for developing Grok, an AI chatbot and image generator.

“Tesla’s investment was made on market terms consistent with those previously agreed to by other investors in the financing round,” the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings report.

When Musk formed xAI as a Nevada public benefit corporation in March 2023, he did so without immediately disclosing the existence the company to Tesla shareholders. He debuted xAI in July that year, and the company dropped the public benefit corporation and related commitments in 2024.

Of late, xAI has been at the center of regulatory probes across the globe concerning Grok. A recent Grok release, integrated into X, had enabled the widespread creation and dissemination of deepfake explicit images, based on photos of real people without their consent.

The European Commission recently initiated a formal probe, as did the California Department of Justice, and agencies in Australia, India, Ireland and France. Other countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, rapidly moved to suspend Grok until the company stops enabling mass production of content deemed illegal in their jurisdictions.

Tesla includes Grok as a feature in some electric vehicle infotainment systems.

In Tesla’s shareholder deck on Wednesday, the company said it had “entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment,” to begin “evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.”

Other issues I’m seeing…

# Liquidity

Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle. Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets. A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally. On the other hand, when the liquidity dries up, markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong.

Many traders don’t look at liquidity at all, others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening, but that’s only part of the story.

Another important tool is the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility, commonly referred to as RRP. This program allows large financial institutions, especially money market funds, to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities.

Last year, markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system. Essentially, RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process.

Take a look at RRP now…

[https://ibb.co/YB4j38XR](https://ibb.co/YB4j38XR)

That cushion is now essentially gone. Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today. That is essentially nothing.

When the tank is empty, it becomes concerning. The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone, and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward; this is generally negative for stocks.

# Put/Call Ratio

One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the put/call ratio.

This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option. When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection. Being that this is a contrary an indicator, this often marks market bottoms. Low readings, generally below 0.55, signal complacency and excessive optimism, which tend to show up near market tops.

Right now, the equity put call ratio is at .54, so yeah, it’s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon.

# XLY vs. XLP

Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) vs. Consumer Staples (XLP).

XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food, beverages, and household products. Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment. XLY represents more discretionary spending, including companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Home Depot. These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances.

When XLY outperforms XLP, it signals a risk on environment. Consumers are spending freely, and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market. When XLP starts to outperform XLY, it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities. That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign, even if the broader market is still climbing.

See Chart...

[https://ibb.co/1f76phVb](https://ibb.co/1f76phVb)

We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary. That shift does not mean a selloff is about to happen. Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build. However, it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface.

As of late January 2026, XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY. When you combine that with a put/call ratio hovering near complacent levels, it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising.

Most people probably don’t even know what I’m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 9-11 is quickly approaching, but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around.

You should digest this information however you wish. There’s no reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other, but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February, which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years, is simply good financial positioning.","Conditions May Be Shifting...

*\*And in part as outrageous as they are, there's a good reason they dominate the headlines to allow the structural financial re-engineering required to proceed without the mass public truly noticing.\**

I’ve taken a position in FXY because I’m betting on a fundamental regime change where the interests of Washington and Tokyo are finding their shared sweet spot.

My thesis is built on a rare alignment: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants a weaker dollar to juice American reshoring as questionable as this methodology may be, while PM Sanae Takaichi desperately needs a stronger Yen to kill the import inflation that’s becoming a political liability and domestic cost of living crisis issue.

I’ve intentionally sidestepped the Bond dump risks inherent in Japanese Government Bond (JGB) funds, choosing FXY as the cleanest, most surgical tool to capture the Yen’s recovery. The alternative is straight Forex trading of course.

The market is slowly validating the move, with this week’s Rate Checks acting as a warning light for a coordinated central bank push. In light of this, I feel we may be seeing a Fed End-Run where, rather than letting Japan dump Treasuries and spike US yields, the Fed is printing USD to buy Yen on Japan's behalf.

This weakens the Dollar and strengthens the Yen without breaking the bond market and tanking the reputation of Treasurys. The recent velocity of the USD/JPY, which has already move from 159 down toward 152 in a matter of days, is the first indicator that the massive carry trade is beginning to unwind. 

The cryptocurrency pullback recently experienced is typical of high-risk positions being first to get trimmed when liquidity tightens, as capital is pulled out of highest-to-lowest risk stocks, and best runner profit margins are secured. 

In terms of targets, my target for FXY is a realistic $69-72 per share. After factoring in the fund’s internal decay (representing roughly 9,180 Yen per share), this price reflects a goldilocks exchange rate of roughly 132-130 USD/JPY.

This is an asymmetrical bet on a structural global shift.

If a sharp dump of the stock market actually hits in 2026, FXY and the Yen become a runner. Personally, I would stay away from leveraged ETPs due to increased decay over medium and longer terms, over anything past a multi-day trade.

I'm still in several undervalued stocks, and plan to hold through a downturn, but have trimmed some high runners such as UAMY, and increased FXY as my hedge going into a turbulent 2026.

Entire AI supply chain, from Blackwell to Apple’s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly. And they are sold out until 2027.

The general assumption is that an H100/Blackwell GPU is just silicon, but the chip sits on a substrate (that green board). If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow, the chip cracks and dies.

To prevent warping, you need Low CTE Glass (often called ""T-Glass""), which is currently manufactured by Nittobo (Japan) which is currently sold out, hence Apple/Qualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply.

Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ. They need a second source to reduce risk.

Also, they are the only non Chinese option. US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives, and Nittobo is maxed out. Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers (Unimicron, Nan Ya).

The stock is up 200% over the last year, but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news.

The market opened down about 0.3% that morning. For some reason, purely on feeling, I wanted to buy out-of-the-money SPY calls and put my entire non-registered account into that trade.

The contracts were trading at $0.05 each.

I was honestly confident. But I didn’t pull the trigger because I didn’t want to sell my S&P 500 shares and deal with taxes. So I stayed disciplined and did nothing.

Two hours later, Trump announces he found an arrangement with Greenland.

SPY pumps 1.2% almost instantly.

Those same calls go from $0.05 to $2.65.

That’s a 53x move. About a 5,200% gain.

If I had gone all in like my instinct told me, it would’ve been life-changing money.

Instead, I watched it happen from the sidelines.

Now every day when I go to work, I think about it. I replay it in my head. “What if I just clicked buy.” It’s brutal. I know logically this is just part of trading and you can’t catch everything, but emotionally it feels different when it’s that big.

How do you actually move on from missing something like this?

How do you stop letting a single trade live rent-free in your head?

Would really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.","Missed a trade that would’ve been life-changing and I can’t stop thinking about it

Nvidia is sitting at roughly $4.62 Trillion while Google is at $3.99 Trillion. The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $380.50. That is just a 15.8% move from the current price of roughly $328 based on the close numbers.

Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot? It wasn't just a number, it was a psychological trigger. The moment they hit #1, every news outlet ran the headline, ETFs rebalanced, and retail chased the winner. Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up.  Once **across $380.50, the ""Google is King"" headlines start**, and the momentum buying kicks in. 

**The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance**

Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri. Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured. They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices, and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices. Google now owns the AI layer on **100% of the mobile distribution channel**. No other competitor exists at this scale. They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market.

**They are cloud leaders**

Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft. We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand.  
Q3 2025 Revenue: $15.15 billion (up **34% year-over-year**).  
Annualized Run Rate: The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $61 billion.  
Operating Income: A record $3.59 billion for the third quarter, representing a 23.7% operating margin, indicating rapidly increasing profitability.  
Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a **$155 billion backlog.**

  
**They are entertainment leaders**

Youtube surpassed Netflix (and all other streaming services)  
According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report, YouTube captured 13.4% of total TV time, Netflix at 8.8%. Also Netflix: 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when it;s over (like now with stranger things) while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like.   
  
**Google has it's own silicon**

Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade, meaning they don't pay the ""Nvidia Tax"" that crushes other tech companies margins.

Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers. Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon? If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear. They instantly become a potential top-tier AI chip supplier with massive margins, they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV. This is a multi-billion dollar catalyst that is currently not being priced.

**Even the valuation show's google is STILL mispriced**

Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidia's future while ignoring Google's present cash flow.

Look at the P/E ratio comparison. Google 32.6x P/E. For Nvidia,45.8x P/E. **That makes Google roughly 29% cheaper on PE valuation basis.**

If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia, its stock price would be roughly $460. to hit $400 target, al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly.

**Wall Street is quietly loading up**

Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $400 target. Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $400 target. Canaccord raised their target to $390. they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings.

**The non digital assets**

Pixel 10 sales were up 28% year-over-year in September, capturing **7% of the US premium market** and stealing share directly from Samsung. And Waymo driverless taxi is no longer a side project. They are doing **450,000 paid rides** per week. They are live in Phoenix, SF, LA, and expanding fast. 

**TLDR**

Google is winning on search, youtube, ads, cloud, AI Chip, driverless cars, mobile phones and is about to become the world's most valuable company.

**On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $380.50 and after the call continue to $400.**

\*I’m holding 10k USD worth of $375C for Feb 6. I am calling Google at $400. I know that most of you are holding GOOG, so good luck tp us all.

After stock splits and one of the most extreme compounding runs in market history, those four original shares would today be worth just under $500,000.  
Now imagine applying that same compounding logic to SpaceX, even if it does not start small. Assume, conservatively, that any eventual public pricing begins around a $1.5 trillion valuation. That number sounds enormous until you shift the frame from cheap to foundational. The companies that generated generational wealth over the last 30 to 40 years were not just successful businesses. They became infrastructure. SpaceX is positioning itself in exactly that role, not merely as a rocket company, but as a transportation, launch, communications, and orbital logistics platform.

  
If you care about truly building wealth, the kind you can give to your kids, the kind that pays for college and maybe even helps them buy their first home, I cannot think of a better company than SpaceX. It is still pre-IPO, but it is not hard to imagine a future where Musk works out some mechanism that allows ordinary people to buy in early. Maybe even young couples, with one simple condition, that they are actually building families. Population decline is a real problem, and it is something Musk talks about openly and often. This part is admittedly wishful thinking, and it may not even be legal as described, though history suggests there are always ways to make things possible when incentives align.

I had around 50,000$ saved up and most of it was invested in the S&P 500. I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined, with my spending. I made sure to put my money into the S&P 500 because I thought it was an investment.

A days ago I made a huge mistake. I did something wrong and it was all my fault. I totally messed things up with my actions. The mistake I made was an one. It happened a few days ago.

I was trading options. I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day. Trading options can be really bad, for me I mean I was doing okay. Then I made some bad choices. Now I have lost a lot of my capital. I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading.

The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it. I think about why I did it and that's what makes it worse. Doing it was bad. The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse.

I was really close to making a mistake with my money. I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right.. Then I thought about it. I knew it was a bad idea. It was too risky and not very smart. So I did not do it. A few hours went by. Then I heard some news, about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland. If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was lucky I did not make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons. The trade would have worked out well. It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right. I am glad I did not put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money.

That really messed with my head. Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working. Seeing that was a shock, to me.

I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right. That is when I started trading to get back at the market. I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good, for me. I did not have a plan. I was not managing my risk. I was only thinking about how I felt. I let my emotions take over. I was only thinking about revenge trading.

My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone. I had a lot of money in my savings. Now half of my savings are just not there anymore.

I feel sick. I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated. I just cannot stop thinking about what happened over in my head. My life is young. I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did. I keep thinking about my life. How I feel like I made a big mistake. My life and my choices are really bothering me.

If anyone has gone through something like this. With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice, on options and gambling and revenge trading.

*As a result I'm posting this now, despite not being as fresh-to-market news, to ensure those who are looking into FinTech in the current landscape are aware of the risks present.*

Dave Inc. (DAVE) has recently received a significant threat to its business model as of December 30, 2025.

\***Judicial and regulatory bodies are beginning  to clamp down on predatory FinTech practices which are being masked as voluntary contributions, charitable tips, and fees & charges.**\*

\*\***The small news that skipped headlines (but with a big cascade risk) is the Baltimore v Dave Inc lawsuit filed December 30, 2025**\*\*

If the Baltimore City lawsuit (filed December 30, 2025) successfully argues that these charges are ""finance charges"" under 12 C.F.R. § 1026.4 (Regulation Z), Dave’s effective APR (often exceeding 400%) would violate Maryland’s 33% usury cap and significantly impact Dave's bottom line, profitability and business model.

This follows the precedent in District of Columbia v. EarnIn (Nov. 2024), where the DC Attorney General sued a near-identical provider for charging fees that yielded a 300% APR, rejecting the defense that these payments were voluntary ""donations."" 

\**This led to the case law and precedent referred to as \*EarnIn doctrine\* that donations are not voluntary, and fees are part of the loan*.\*

\**Critically*\* the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Regulatory integration of the doctrine into the 2024 Interpretive Rule. This regulation has been refined in \*\*December 2025\*\* enforcing the interpretation that ""tips"" and ""expedited delivery fees"" are considered ""credit"" subject to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) if they are part and parcel of the extension of funds.

DAVE and other FinTech/BNPL/Advance lenders rely on state Safe Harbor laws to bypass APR limits currently. 

Other lenders are also getting rapidly hit by agencies (California DFPI v OppFi, Baltimore v MoneyLion, 2025, New York AG v MoneyLion, CFPB v MoneyLion, DC v EarnIn 2025, FTC v CleoAI, Rubin v EarnIn, Aug 2025, and the number of lawsuits are increasing)

The problem? 

\*\***More Precedents!\***\*

City of Miami v. Gonzalez (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2025), which went to Court of Appeals final ruling established that municipal charters can empower cities to enforce local consumer protections even where state laws are permissive, effectively allowing Baltimore to and other cities to ignore state level permission laws \*AND apply the EarnIn Doctrine\*. 

As a double whammy, the DOJ is naming CEO Jason Wilk as a personal defendant in its amended complaint (Dec. 2025), which is almost a replica of the FTC v Brigit 2024 case, where Brigit had to pay a $18 million settlement for deceptive fee-harvesting interfaces \*\**AND a permanent injunction*\*\*. CleoAI also had to settle a case with conditions against the FTC for $17M. 

On an ethical and legal front, recent revelations of exploiting ""charitable"" nudges to the bottom line $149 million tip revenue, Dave is increasingly exposed to a multi-front wave of municipal and federal litigation, and also souring retail & ethical sentiment.

If these revenue drivers are deemed illegal interest, Dave loses its primary margin engine. Its core revenue generator turns into an unlicensed, high-interest loan.

A single 40k share institutional sell block on Dec 29 over a holiday trading period immediately following the news, is a warning signal investors might want to be aware of if currently holding a DAVE position. 

While some risk is built into the current price, a bigger downside risk exists if multiple city & state jurisdictions follow Baltimore's lead - possibility of numerous settlements, restrictions and injunctions can potentially severely cripple the business model.

\**Disclaimer: Previous Dave bull here.

Google: Major Risks for GOOGL and the Scaling Opportunity for Digital Turbine (APPS),"The ongoing proceedings have confirmed that Google’s ""Play Store"" dominance is being challenged not just on a monetary basis (the 30% fee), but on a technical infrastructure level. The court is focused on the ""friction"" Google creates to prevent third-party app stores and direct installations.

1. The Risk for Google ($GOOGL):

Google’s high-margin Services segment relies on the ""toll-gate"" model. If the judge enforces the October Injunction (as indicated in the Jan 22nd hearing), Google loses the ability to mandate the Play Store billing system.

""Scare Screens"" Ban: The court is moving toward banning the ""warning"" messages users see when side-loading apps. This removes Google’s primary psychological and technical barrier to competition.

Google is under fire for trying to implement ""security fees"" to replace lost commissions. The judge has signaled he may reject any fees that aren't based on actual marginal costs.

2. The Opportunity for Digital Turbine ($APPS):

The SingleTap Patent Moat: During the trial, it was revealed that Epic conducted A/B testing with Digital Turbine. The results showed a massive increase in conversion when using DT’s ""frictionless"" installation technology compared to Google’s standard flow.

As the ""Gatekeeper"" walls fall, third-party stores (Xbox Mobile, Epic Store, Meta Direct Ads) need a delivery mechanism. Digital Turbine’s SingleTap is the only patented technology currently integrated with Carriers and OEMs that can bypass the Play Store friction legally.

The ""March 2026"" Inflection Point: With the judge rejecting a ""sweetheart deal"" between Google and Epic on Jan 22, the original, more aggressive injunction remains the baseline. This paves the way for a massive scaling of installations/day for DT starting in H2 2026.

3. The Epic Games Factor:

Epic isn't just fighting for Fortnite; they are fighting for the right to run a full-scale mobile marketplace. Their reliance on DT’s tech during testing proves that the ""Alternative Distribution"" market is ready for commercial scale.

The market is currently pricing in ""uncertainty,"" but the technical filings suggest a structural shift. If Google is forced to open its APIs by March, the ""operating leverage"" for platform companies like Digital Turbine could trigger a significant re-rating as they transition from ad-networks to core utility infrastructure for Android.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

> The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025, just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world. This is evident from their most recent investment overview, which ABP always publishes with a three-month delay.

> At the end of March, the value of US government bonds in ABP's books was still more than €29 billion. At the end of September, ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US, more than a third less.

> Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US. The billions that are no longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany. During the same period, ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany.

> In an interview with Fox News yesterday, Trump threatened “major retaliation” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds. With around €500 billion in pension funds, ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide.

> **Multiple factors**

> The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value. Rising interest rates on government bonds, for example, can depress their value. In addition, the new Dutch pension system may also play a role. Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds.

> In this case, the higher interest rates are not playing a major role, according to pension experts. Shortly after Trump's announcement of import tariffs in April 2025, bond interest rates rose sharply, but that increase has been virtually wiped out. So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value, says Bas Werker, professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar.

> Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP, according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON: “If you exchange US bonds for European bonds, you are not disposing of bonds.”

> **Selling**

> ABP's deliberate policy, i.e., selling or not repurchasing, therefore seems to play a major role. “Trump's unpredictability, and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty, are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and non-financial resilience,” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels.

> ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment.

> ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively. “That is what our investment mix is aimed at,” said the spokesperson. Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies.

> **US debt**

> For decades, the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world, but rising government spending is increasing the national debt. This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts.

> High debt is not a problem as long as enough countries, investors, and individuals are willing to hold dollars. Trump's import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries. Since his second term as president, the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent.

> Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank, the Fed, to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This fall, the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds.

> **Danish pension funds**

> This week, it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds. These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights. A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trump's threat to take Greenland.

> “This decision is the result of weak US public finances,” said Anders Schelde, head of investments at the Danish teachers' pension fund. According to him, it is a matter of risk management. The money is now being invested in less risky investments.

> Like ABP, the Danish teachers' pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the two cannot be viewed entirely separately: “Of course, that doesn't make it any easier to take such a decision ...[truncated]","Yearly report reveals 5th largest pensionfund in the world quietly sold 10 out of its 29 billion in US Bonds

MANAGEMENT IS NOT INSANE, THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS

Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing  
Snapchat glasses are releasing this year

If the glasses fail and he scraps them, Snapchat saves roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger.

Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible.

One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses.

Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave.

  
**Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month**  
Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint.

And let’s be honest, the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for

  
“Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.”

Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks.

Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change

Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year

A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge.

Anterix (ATEX) is a deep-value play on Smart Grids' needs for critical radio frequency communication.

\*\***As of writing, ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band, a specialised frequency critical for the multi-trillion dollar US grid modernisation**.\*\*

The current market cap sits at approximately $473 million, with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $3B across 60+ potential utility customers. Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability, with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $100 million from the previous $80 million guidance.

On a business metrics and stock mathematics level, there is a significant valuation gap and a debt-free balance sheet. ATEX currently trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 4.9x, a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of \~16x.

This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company’s $250 million authorised share repurchase program, which remains active through to September 2026.

\***As of the most recent filings, over $227 million remains on this authorisation - a figure representing nearly 48% of the company's total market capitalisation**.\*

This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy, it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count, effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies per-share value as revenue from long-term utility contracts scales.

From a technical and operational standpoint, the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic de-risking. The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase, evidenced by the $147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments. The stock chart reflects this momentum; after bottoming in late 2025 near $18, ATEX has established a strong ascending channel, with current technical support firming up around $23.50 - $24.00. With $39 million in cash and zero debt, Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to re-rate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $50 - $55, which aligns with conservative spectrum-valuation methodologies of \~$0.40/MHz-pop.

\*\*Wireless Company Valuation\*\*

*Conservative*

If one applies a conservative $0.40/MHz pop math to Anterix’s nationwide footprint:

2.0 Billion MHz-pops x $0.40 = $800 Million (Spectrum Value)

Add: \~$40M Cash + \~$140M in Contracted Receivables. Subtract: liabilities/burn. Divide by: \~18-19 million shares.

This calculation results in a price per share in the $50 range

*Bull*

At (already in contract with SDG&E) $2/MHz pop, this valuation quickly shifts to $200-250/ps

Entry: $23-26 Target: $65

# Part I: The Political Detonator: The Takaichi Gambit and the 4% Barrier

Since our last assessment, the ""Great Liquidity Era"" has entered a chaotic terminal phase. On January 19, 2026, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s first female premier, shattered the remaining market calm by calling a snap election for February 8, 2026. This is not a standard political maneuver; it is a high-stakes referendum on ""proactive fiscal spending"" that has effectively declared war on the bond market.

The Super-Long Yield Shock

While the world was watching the 10-year JGB, the real carnage has moved to the ""back end"" of the curve. The 30-year JGB yield has ripped to 3.83%, while the 40-year yield has pierced the psychological 4.0% ceiling.

This is a structural shift in the Term Premium. Investors are no longer just pricing in higher overnight rates; they are pricing in fiscal risk. The Takaichi administration’s proposal to cut sales taxes on food, estimated to cost the treasury 0.6% of GDP, has signaled to the world that Japan is opting for populism over solvency.

The Mathematics of Maturity

For thirty years, Japan’s debt was ""sustainable"" because it was pinned to a zero-bound. Today, that debt is being repriced at the speed of a high-frequency trade.

* **The Yield Velocity:** The speed ($dy/dt$) of the move in the 30-year bond is now outpacing its G7 peers.
* **The Duration Trap:** Because Japan’s debt has a high average maturity, these moves in the 30-year and 40-year yields are devastating. For every 10-basis point move in the super-long end, the ""mark-to-market"" loss on the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) balance sheet and the portfolios of domestic ""lifers"" (insurers) is catastrophic.

# Part II: The Policy Paradox: BOJ vs. Ministry of Finance

We are now witnessing the ""Truss-ification"" of the Japanese Yen. The dynamic between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has shifted from coordination to active sabotage.

The MoF’s Debt Servicing Nightmare

The Ministry of Finance has officially raised its ""assumed interest rate"" for the FY2026 budget to 3.0%, the highest in nearly three decades. At this level, Japan’s debt servicing costs are projected to explode to over 31.3 trillion yen.

>

The BOJ’s Mandate of Thorns

Governor Ueda and the BOJ are trapped.

* To fight inflation (core at 2.6%), the BOJ must raise the policy rate and reduce JGB purchases (Quantitative Tightening).
* To save the MoF, the BOJ would need to restart Yield Curve Control (YCC) to cap the 30-year yield at 4%.

However, if the BOJ caps yields while the MoF prints money for stimulus, the Yen collapses. If the BOJ allows yields to market-price, the MoF goes insolvent. They are no longer partners; they are two pilots fighting for control of the same stick while the plane is in a nose-dive.

# Part III: The Yen Carry Trade Unwind: The Great Repatriation

The surge in the 40-year yield to 4% has changed the ""Internal Rate of Return"" (IRR) for Japan’s massive institutional investors. This is the ""Passive Structural Breach"" we feared.

Japanese life insurers and pension funds, the world's largest ""whales"", no longer need to hunt for yield in 4.5% US Treasuries. When you factor in the cost of hedging USD/JPY volatility, a 4% risk-free return in their home currency (JPY) is mathematically superior to a 4.8% return in USD.

The ""Infinite Money Glitch"" hasn't just stopped; it has reversed. The trillions of Yen that fueled the Nasdaq and the US housing market are being pulled back to Tokyo to fund the Japanese government's record-breaking interest bill.

For thirty years, the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy: the Japanese Yen. It was the ""infinite money glitch,"" a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history. But yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) did not just raise rates; they shattered the glass floor. With the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield finally piercing the 2.02% threshold, the ""Great Liquidity Era"" has officially met its end.

As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape, I need you to understand that we are not just looking at a currency fluctuation. We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade. If you are not watching the Yen, you are flying blind into a hurricane.

# I. The Architecture of the Glitch: 30 Years of QE and YCC

Since 1990, Japan has been a laboratory for ""Extraordinary Monetary Policy."" To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation, the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). By pinning JGB yields near zero, the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth.

This birthed the Yen Carry Trade: investors borrow JPY at near-zero rates, sell it for USD, and buy high-yielding US Treasuries or high-growth Nasdaq tech. This was not just a trade; it was a systemic short-volatility bet. As long as Japan stayed ""frozen,"" the world had a ""BOJ Put."" However, tha ...[truncated]","Grey Swan: Why the Rise in Japan 30 and 40 Year Bond Yield Will Cause Yen Carry Trade Unwind and Fuel a Global Financial Meltdown

We are now witnessing the ""Truss-ification"" of the Japanese Yen. The dynamic between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has shifted from coordination to active sabotage.

The MoF’s Debt Servicing Nightmare

The Ministry of Finance has officially raised its ""assumed interest rate"" for the FY2026 budget to 3.0%, the highest in nearly three decades. At this level, Japan’s debt servicing costs are projected to explode to over 31.3 trillion yen.

>

The BOJ’s Mandate of Thorns

Governor Ueda and the BOJ are trapped.

* To fight inflation (core at 2.6%), the BOJ must raise the policy rate and reduce JGB purchases (Quantitative Tightening).
* To save the MoF, the BOJ would need to restart Yield Curve Control (YCC) to cap the 30-year yield at 4%.

However, if the BOJ caps yields while the MoF prints money for stimulus, the Yen collapses. If the BOJ allows yields to market-price, the MoF goes insolvent. They are no longer partners; they are two pilots fighting for control of the same stick while the plane is in a nose-dive.

# Part III: The Yen Carry Trade Unwind: The Great Repatriation

The surge in the 40-year yield to 4% has changed the ""Internal Rate of Return"" (IRR) for Japan’s massive institutional investors. This is the ""Passive Structural Breach"" we feared.

Japanese life insurers and pension funds, the world's largest ""whales"", no longer need to hunt for yield in 4.5% US Treasuries. When you factor in the cost of hedging USD/JPY volatility, a 4% risk-free return in their home currency (JPY) is mathematically superior to a 4.8% return in USD.

The ""Infinite Money Glitch"" hasn't just stopped; it has reversed. The trillions of Yen that fueled the Nasdaq and the US housing market are being pulled back to Tokyo to fund the Japanese government's record-breaking interest bill.

For thirty years, the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy: the Japanese Yen. It was the ""infinite money glitch,"" a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history. But yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) did not just raise rates; they shattered the glass floor. With the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield finally piercing the 2.02% threshold, the ""Great Liquidity Era"" has officially met its end.

As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape, I need you to understand that we are not just looking at a currency fluctuation. We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade. If you are not watching the Yen, you are flying blind into a hurricane.

# I. The Architecture of the Glitch: 30 Years of QE and YCC

Since 1990, Japan has been a laboratory for ""Extraordinary Monetary Policy."" To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation, the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). By pinning JGB yields near zero, the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth.

This birthed the Yen Carry Trade: investors borrow JPY at near-zero rates, sell it for USD, and buy high-yielding US Treasuries or high-growth Nasdaq tech. This was not just a trade; it was a systemic short-volatility bet. As long as Japan stayed ""frozen,"" the world had a ""BOJ Put.""

Yields on Treasuries have been relatively high over the past few months, and some parts of the curve have even moved up. Yet, the indexes (S&P, Nasdaq) are still near highs.

In the early weeks of 2026, the frozen landscape of the Arctic has transformed into the most volatile theater in global geopolitics. What began as the ""Greenland Crisis"" has rapidly escalated from a diplomatic curiosity into a full-blown transatlantic fracture. At the epicenter of this dispute is a renewed, aggressive demand from Washington for the United States to purchase Greenland. This is a proposition the Danish government has repeatedly, and perhaps fatefully, characterized as ""absurd.""

# The Greenland-Denmark Nexus

To understand the stakes, one must look at the structural ties binding the North Atlantic. While Greenland is a self-governing, autonomous territory, it remains an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

* Financial Dependency: Copenhagen provides a substantial annual subsidy, known as the block grant, which accounts for roughly half of Greenland’s public budget.
* Strategic Leverage: For Denmark, Greenland is not merely territory; it is the bedrock of their status as an Arctic power and their primary source of strategic leverage within the NATO alliance.

# The Novo Nordisk Risk

However, the true vulnerability of Denmark lies not in its military outposts, but on its balance sheet. We are witnessing a possible ""black swan"" event for the Danish economy centered on a single corporate giant. Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical titan behind the blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has achieved such staggering scale that its market capitalization frequently exceeds Denmark's entire annual GDP.

This economic concentration creates a unique geopolitical fragility:

* The Pension Anchor: The link to the Danish citizenry is direct and visceral. Danish pension funds, most notably ATP (the nation's largest supplementary provider), are heavily overweight in Novo Nordisk stock.
* Retirement Security: As the company’s valuation soared, it became the foundation of Danish retirement security.
* The Doom Loop: If Novo Nordisk is targeted, a ""Pension Doom Loop"" begins: a hit to the stock is a direct hit to the future solvency of the Danish middle class.

By threatening Novo Nordisk, Washington isn't just targeting a company; it is actively undermining the financial sovereignty of the Danish state to force a hand on the Greenland sale.

# Section 2: The Entity List: From Trade Tool to Financial Tactical Nuke

To grasp the gravity of a move against Novo Nordisk, one must understand the mechanisms of the Entity List, managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).

# What is the Entity List?

Unlike a standard tariff, which merely increases the cost of a product, the Entity List functions as a technological and commercial blockade. It prohibits U.S. companies from exporting, re-exporting, or transferring specific technologies, software, or components to the listed entity without a specialized license that is notoriously difficult to obtain.

# The Huawei Precedent

The strategic blueprint for this move was established in 2019 when the Trump administration placed Huawei on the list, citing 5G national security concerns. The impact was surgical:

* Supply Chain Strangulation: Huawei was severed from vital U.S. semiconductors and the Google Android ecosystem.
* Market Share Collapse: Within two years, their global smartphone business plummeted from the #1 spot to the ""others"" category.
* Strategic Containment: It effectively forced global allies to make a binary choice between U.S. technology and Chinese hardware.

Applying this logic to Novo Nordisk represents a radical expansion of the ""national security"" definition. If the U.S. declares that ""Danish intransigence in the Arctic poses a threat to U.S. polar security,"" the Entity List becomes the ultimate tool to hold the world’s second most valuable pharmaceutical pipeline hostage until a deal is struck.

# Section 3: The $500 Billion Erasure: Why Novo Nordisk Faces an 80% Drawdown

This is the ""Doom Scenario"" for NVO shareholders. This would not be a standard market correction; it would be the systematic destruction of equity value.

# The 80% Drawdown Thesis

In a normal market, a poor earnings report might cause a 10% dip. However, an Entity List designation is a terminal event for a foreign firm dependent on U.S. markets. An 80% collapse is justified by four catastrophic pillars:

* Revenue Amputation: Approximately 55% of Novo’s revenue would vanish overnight as the U.S. border effectively slams shut to Ozempic and Wegovy shipments.
* The ""Illegal Drug"" Designation: Once on the list, U.S. insurance giants like UnitedHealth and CVS would likely be legally barred from processing payments to a blacklisted entity. The world’s most sought-after medications would be treated as ""contraband"" in their most lucrative market.
* Manufacturing Seizure: Novo’s massive production facilities in Clayton, North Carolina, would likely be placed under ""protective custody"" ...[truncated]","Black Swan | The Greenland Gambit: Why Novo Nordisk (NVO) is the Ultimate Geopolitical Pawn | Denmark's Crown Jewel on US Entity Black List

That trust is evaporating. When the US political system looks erratic, foreign governments stop seeing Microsoft or Google as neutral tools. They start seeing them as liability risks from a volatile superpower.

The counter-argument is these products are sticky and hard to change. That's true, Corporate IT switching costs are brutal. This isn't going to be a cliff where revenue drops 20% overnight.

But change happens on the margins. It's not about losing the current customer. it's about losing the next one.

\- It's the German government choosing a local provider for their next 10-year cloud contract instead of Microsoft.  
\- It's France passing laws that force data to stay in-country, destroying margins.  
\- It's the Global South adopting Chinese stacks because they don't want to be reliant on US policy whims.

This won't be a crash. It will be a slow, painful drag on growth for the next decade.

So why has the market been doing well? I think the market was betting heavily that this political chaos is just ""temporary noise"" once Trump is gone everything snaps back to 2015 normalcy, and not pricing in enough of the reverse (for which there is plenty of catalyst such as seemingly never ending political polarization).

My argument isn't that we crash tomorrow. It's that we are permanently damaging the infrastructure of trust that allows US tech to print money globally. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. The market is pricing in ""volatility"" (which passes). It isn't pricing in ""erosion"" (which is long-term).","A bear case for Mag7: US is burning its ""Trust Capital""

Looking at the actual revenue split of the biggest US companies, such as the Mag 7. You can argue that they aren't really American companies anymore. They are global utilities that just happen to pay taxes in California.

When it comes to news and investing it’s pretty tempting to think a) that big ‘news’ events will affect the market, and b) that you can buy / sell something to benefit and profit from that news. 

The truth though? It’s doesn’t happen anywhere near as much as we think it does. 

The way that I think about it is on one extreme you have:
-  ‘really big news that crashes the market’ and then on the other end you have, 
- ‘really big news that a lot of people THINK is gonna the market then nothing really happens.’

Now when you really think about it, which of these happens more? It’s definitely the second one. 

Just think, in the last few months all the chat we’ve had about debt ceiling stuff, Iran nuclear facilities bombings, the Ukraine war, Venezuela, Greenland, investigating the Fed chair, Iran protests, on again, off again tariffs with a dozen different places. And how all of those things were gonna be bad for the market or even crash it. Hasn’t really happened has it? 

The strategy of successful investors I learned from was to just tune out a lot of that stuff as ‘noise’ cause living in all that noise and trying to react to it all is actually super distracting and not great for your investing. 

And by investing I mean buying businesses that do their thing well and holding them while they grow their earnings and then their value (market cap, share price) grows with that. If you want to trade day to day news, there’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s basically a coin flip so the odds aren’t with you there.","Profiting from news and events?

Trump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.

JPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.

During the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.

Earlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.

The president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.

“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”

Trump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.

Dimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: ""Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”

Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.

Here’s what we know so far:

→ 200M+ monthly active users

→ Valued at $15B in its last funding round (2021)

→ $600M+ in annual revenue (estimated)

→ $500M raised in their last funding round



Discord started as a gaming chat app in 2015. Today, they host communities for everything: beatboxing, investing, AI, crypto, you name it.



Back in 2021, Discord rejected a $12B offer from Microsoft. Now, they’re going public, aiming for even higher valuation.



Here's what makes Discord different:

They’ve built a $600M+ business mostly without ads - something nearly unheard of at this scale.



While Meta, X, and TikTok are 90%+ ad-driven, Discord's core model is:

\- Nitro subscriptions ($9.99/mo)

\- Server boosts

\- Game distribution fees



They only introduced ""Quests"" (sponsored challenges) in 2024, years after hitting massive scale. Most platforms start with ads but Discord added them as a bonus, not a crutch.



The timing makes sense too. After a 3-year IPO freeze, the market is finally warming up. Tech IPOs raised $15.6B last year - double the year before - and Discord is riding that momentum!



If they go public anywhere near their $15B valuation, it’s a major validation of a subscription-first monetization model for social platforms. It shows you don’t have to run ads to build a billion-dollar consumer business."" ( i found this post)



What do you think is a good evaluation to buy it when it launches?

We know Discord has no competition in gaming and , if we bet that they will go against Teams for businesses, they can get a high market for business meeting apps.","Discord IPO opinions

* SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter.

Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I ""staggered"" the investment period by starting and ending it on ""Inauguration Day"" rather than ""New Year's Day"". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the ""staggered years"". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio ""invests"" at the close of the starting day for each period.)

A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post.

# US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation

We have data for US equities, ""cash"" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting.

|CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\+10.28%|\+10.23%|\+3.33%|\+2.95%|
|Republican|47.68|\+6.58%|\+6.33%|\+4.34%|\+2.22%|
|Democratic|51.88|\+13.80%|\+13.95%|\+2.42%|\+3.63%|
|Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\+11.49%|\+11.47%|\+3.68%|\+3.71%|
|Republican|41.00|\+9.07%|\+8.96%|\+4.69%|\+3.43%|
|Democratic|45.00|\+13.74%|\+13.81%|\+2.77%|\+3.97%|

Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%).

We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%).

Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills.

# US Equities vs. Treasuries

Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills.

|CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\+10.52%|\+10.58%|\+4.52%|\+6.01%|\+3.77%|
|Republican|33.00|\+7.54%|\+7.39%|\+5.27%|\+8.94%|\+3.92%|
|Democratic|31.05|\+13.78%|\+14.06%|\+3.72%|\+2.98%|\+3.60%|

During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%).

Why?,"2025 was a green year for most countries, with solid gains everywhere. But amid the bull run, returns varied wildly and **South Korea crushed it with +77.8%**. Just wow! But why?

Breaking it down:

* **Semiconductor mega-rebound (the big driver):** Korea's market is all about semis. Samsung (+155%) and SK Hynix (+275%) dominate the KOSPI. 2025 brought a huge DRAM/NAND cycle recovery, fueled by AI, data centers, GPUs, cloud, and edge computing. SK Hynix nailed it as Nvidia's key HBM supplier!
* **South Korea underperformed US/Europe 2021-2024:** Set up for massive catch-up. Investors chased value, and Korea delivered big time.
* **Rotation to ex-US markets:** Korea checks every box:tech, industrial, export-focused, liquid. Perfect for ditching overpriced US stocks.
* **Weak won + export boost:** KRW stayed soft, supercharging export-heavy firms with higher margins, earnings beats, and stock re-ratings.
* **Concentrated market amps up % gains:** Fewer mega-caps, but giants like these explode the overall cap.

Quick shoutout to Spain's +64.5% killer run, thanks to:

* Booming banks (IBEX heavyweight, low rates juicing lending)
* \~3% GDP surge (beating Euro peers on jobs/investment)
* Tourism explosion (post-COVID come back)
* Infrastructure boom (EU funds for housing/projects)
* Credit upgrades (Moody's/Fitch/S&P drawing investors)
* Edge in cheap energy/resilient exports

You invested in Korean stocks last year. How about now? What stocks (Samsung, SK Hynix)?  
And what country are you betting on for 2026 to pull off something similar?

* **Semiconductor mega-rebound (the big driver):** Korea's market is all about semis. Samsung (+155%) and SK Hynix (+275%) dominate the KOSPI. 2025 brought a huge DRAM/NAND cycle recovery, fueled by AI, data centers, GPUs, cloud, and edge computing. SK Hynix nailed it as Nvidia's key HBM supplier!
* **South Korea underperformed US/Europe 2021-2024:** Set up for massive catch-up. Investors chased value, and Korea delivered big time.
* **Rotation to ex-US markets:** Korea checks every box:tech, industrial, export-focused, liquid. Perfect for ditching overpriced US stocks.
* **Weak won + export boost:** KRW stayed soft, supercharging export-heavy firms with higher margins, earnings beats, and stock re-ratings.
* **Concentrated market amps up % gains:** Fewer mega-caps, but giants like these explode the overall cap.

Quick shoutout to Spain's +64.5% killer run, thanks to:

* Booming banks (IBEX heavyweight, low rates juicing lending)
* \~3% GDP surge (beating Euro peers on jobs/investment)
* Tourism explosion (post-COVID come back)
* Infrastructure boom (EU funds for housing/projects)
* Credit upgrades (Moody's/Fitch/S&P drawing investors)
* Edge in cheap energy/resilient exports

You invested in Korean stocks last year. How about now? What stocks (Samsung, SK Hynix)?  
And what country are you betting on for 2026 to pull off something similar?

OpenAI is rolling out testing of ads to free users and users on cheaper Go plan in the coming weeks.

This is the big catalyst that needed to happen for GOOG earnings to finally take a hit, and what I was waiting for before I begin a short position in the stock. I had bought last April and was hoping to hold 1 year to avoid short term capital gains, but sold recently because I felt the risk is too high to continue holding.

While users have shifted from Google to ChatGPT, it did not impact GOOG's earnings because advertisers(GOOGLE's actual customers) continued to spend on Google- higher revenue per impression/click/conversion, as well as bot traffic from agents made up for drops in real traffic.

But Once OpenAI's ads program expands to all users(rather than just a test), tens of Billions of dollars that are spent on Google ads will be diverted to ChatGPT ads.

Google has increasingly provided poor results for advertisers by providing misleading metrics, charging them for conversions that would've happened regardless of paid ads. For example, if you search for a product, often the company that sells the product is a sponsored result. Looking at their data, it looks like you can predict the cost per conversion, but in reality, you are paying for existing traffic. On top of this, because cost per conversion has been rising, advertisers are looking for alternatives that provide better ROI than Google search ads.

On top of this, Google's display ads via its adsense network is also taking a hit, as partner websites experience less traffic due to AI overviews and general use of LLMs.

ChatGPT ads offer a new way to pay for intent based traffic, and a way for businesses to diversify away from Google. This is likely the beginning of the end for Google.

I believe GOOG faces the biggest threat because ChatGPT represents intent based advertising(Can display ads directly relevant to prompt/query), whereas other advertisers like Meta focus more on interest based advertising(displaying banner ads next to irrelevant content, that the user is expected to be interested in based on Machine learning))

> With U.S. ties at their lowest point in modern history, Canada is turning to one of the only countries with which it had even worse relations: China. Canada is forging a “new strategic partnership” with China, its second-biggest trading partner, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a “historic” trip to Beijing. That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017, met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump’s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence. For Canada, the Trump administration has been especially head-spinning. “The United States used to be a friend and ally,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, told NBC News in an interview. Now, “we are treated as an enemy.”

> As part of an effort to “recalibrate” the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products. It’s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff. Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free.

> Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years. “Further trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,” Ong said. About 75% of Canada’s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures. China is the second-largest market at about 4%.","Canada turns to China as Trump's tariffs and threats bring foes together

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Turns out there's decent academic research on this. High roic combined with low reinvestment needs tends to compound wealth over time. Makes sense because youre buying businesses that generate excess returns and dont need to plow everything back in just to maintain competitive position.

Debt coverage matters more than absolute debt levels. A company with moderate debt but strong interest coverage is safer than a company with low debt but weak cash generation.

Gross margin stability over 5 to 10 years is a better moat indicator than any single year snapshot. If margins are consistent through different economic cycles, theres probably something protecting the business.

Payout ratios below 60% for dividend stocks. Once you get above that youre betting on earnings growth just to maintain the dividend which adds risk.

Free cash flow yield matters more than earnings yield because earnings can be manipulated way easier than actual cash coming in.

Lamborghini belongs to the VW Group (along with Audi). They are awesome cars, but the brand appeals more to ""New Money"" (Crypto, YouTubers, Influencers). It is more vulnerable to trends.The biggest mistake investors make is comparing Ferrari to car manufacturers.

 Founder, Enzo Ferrari said, ""Always build one car less than the market demands."" It doesn't sell transportation. It sells access to an exclusive club. Ferrari has exceptional finances and locked-in revenue for the next two years as it operates on a pre-order basis. Due to inflation, materials have become more expensive. Ferrari raised its prices by 10-15%. Did anyone cancel their order? No. Its customers do not look at the price. This protects its profits from inflation. The average Ferrari customer has many cars in their garage. They do not buy a Ferrari to go to work. They buy it as a collector's item. In a crisis, you are not affected because we are not talking about people who are financially insecure, but about millionaires. The respect that the company itself shows for its product is very important, with its customer base, blacklist, and strict penalties in case of resale or conversion of the car, giving even more the impression that this is not a car company but a company with works of art.

I believe that the decline in share price is occurring for similar reasons as with Google and Uber at the moment. There is a lot of pessimism and speculation (Ferrari is preparing to launch its first all-electric (EV) car in late 2025/early 2026), which will be forgotten over time as it is not very well-founded. This is an exceptional company that has proven many times that every decline acts as a bounce-back spring and acts as a counterweight in bear markets. **I would be happy to hear opposing views in case I am missing something.**","RACE IS IT AN OPPORTUNITY ?

At best, the U.S. would face sweeping sanctions from the EU and allied economies. At worst, it could spark an armed conflict between NATO members, something the global financial system is absolutely not built to handle.

Markets hate uncertainty, and this would be uncertainty on a historic scale. Trade between the U.S. and Europe would likely be disrupted or frozen, shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Arctic would be militarized, and global supply chains would seize up almost overnight. Energy prices would spike, markets would panic, and investor confidence would evaporate.

The U.S. economy is especially vulnerable here because it’s heavily dependent on globalized, high tech supply chains. Semiconductors, rare earth processing, advanced manufacturing none of these exist in isolation. If relations with Europe and allied nations collapse, access to critical components and materials would be severely constrained. A tech-driven economy can’t function if it can’t get chips, equipment, or precision manufacturing machinery.

Beyond the immediate economic damage, the long-term consequences would be even worse: capital flight from U.S. markets, a weakened dollar, and a permanent loss of trust in America as a stable anchor of the global system. A move like this won't just be a geopolitical mistake; it would be economic turmoil on a scale we haven't seen in a long time.","If America invades Greenland the stock market will pay the price

**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Strategy:** Long-Only Tactical Momentum  
**Focus:** NYSE, NASDAQ, TSX  

Markets are chopping as geopolitical headlines (Iran) and mixed bank earnings weigh on the indices. However, **chaos creates ladders**. We are seeing a historic decoupling where Commodities (Gold/Silver/Uranium) and Crypto are ripping while Big Tech takes a breather. This is a stock picker's environment.

Here are the top high-conviction setups for the next 30 days:

| Ticker | Price | Target | Gain % | Risk | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **COIN** | $255.47 | $350.00 | +37% | High | BTC at $95k is the fuel. |
| **CCO.TO** | C$152.17 | C$185.00 | +21% | Med | Nuclear super-cycle breakout. |
| **PAAS** | $55.86 | $75.00 | +34% | High | Silver at $92/oz = Money Printer. |
| **NVDA** | $182.14 | $250.00 | +37% | Med | Best dip-buy in Tech. |

### 🚨 The Thesis

*   **COIN (Coinbase):** Bitcoin is proving to be the safe haven of 2026. With BTC holding $95k, COIN's transaction volumes are set to explode. It's high beta, but the trend is undeniable.
*   **CCO.TO (Cameco):** Energy security is back on the menu. With oil volatile and nuclear adoption growing, Cameco is the premier way to play the uranium squeeze on the TSX.
*   **PAAS (Pan American Silver):** Silver is absolutely parabolic right now (~$92/oz). Miners lag the spot price, which means PAAS has significant catch-up potential. 
*   **NVDA (Nvidia):** The king is resting. Down from highs, NVDA at $182 offers a tactical entry before the next leg of AI capex announcements.

| **COIN** | $255.47 | $350.00 | +37% | High | BTC at $95k is the fuel. |
| **CCO.TO** | C$152.17 | C$185.00 | +21% | Med | Nuclear super-cycle breakout. |
| **PAAS** | $55.86 | $75.00 | +34% | High | Silver at $92/oz = Money Printer. |
| **NVDA** | $182.14 | $250.00 | +37% | Med | Best dip-buy in Tech. |

### 🚨 The Thesis

*   **COIN (Coinbase):** Bitcoin is proving to be the safe haven of 2026. With BTC holding $95k, COIN's transaction volumes are set to explode. It's high beta, but the trend is undeniable.
*   **CCO.TO (Cameco):** Energy security is back on the menu. With oil volatile and nuclear adoption growing, Cameco is the premier way to play the uranium squeeze on the TSX.
*   **PAAS (Pan American Silver):** Silver is absolutely parabolic right now (~$92/oz). Miners lag the spot price, which means PAAS has significant catch-up potential. 
*   **NVDA (Nvidia):** The king is resting. Down from highs, NVDA at $182 offers a tactical entry before the next leg of AI capex announcements.

I am invested entirely in FZROX and FZILX at the moment in my taxable accounts.

1. How concerning of a position is this? Should I make adjustments and find different no/low fee fund moving forward? I can do my own research but if the answer is yes, any fund recommendations I can use with Fidelity?
2. It's my understanding that the reason to avoid using it in taxable accounts is because it's locked into fidelity and can't be transferred, so switching brokerages requires liquidating it and realizing capital gains, then taxes. Is this the only reason why it's not recommended?
3. If the answer to 2 is yes, is it really that much of a risk to hold a fund that can't be transferred out of your brokerage without liquidating? I don't have plans to find another brokerage and it's unlikely Fidelity goes out of business. Or perhaps it's a situation where there's low upside and high downside if something very unlikely occurs?
4. I am planning to retire early. If it is the case that this was a big oopsie, I am assuming I'll begin investing in a new index fund, and simply prioritize withdrawals from the FZROX fund in the early days to decrease my allocation there over time.

Has AI bubble peaked? If you keep reading mainstream media, r/stocks, and listening to Michael Burry, you'd believe it.

You'd be losing a lot of money though.

**Real demand is through the roof:**

* H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months. This is a clear indicator that Burry's claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong. Source mvcinvesting @ X. Can't post link here due to X being banned.

* Burry’s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb. So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better. If companies all buy Nvidia’s new GPUs, Nvidia wins. If no one buys Nvidia’s new GPUs, then there is no faster than expected obsoletion. You can’t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs. Do people not see the glaring issue? Burry’s short reason is completely illogical. The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall. We’re clearly not seeing this. 

* China's Alibaba Justin Lin just said they're severely constrained by inference demand. He said Tencent is the same. They simply do not have compute to meet user demand. They're having to use their precious compute for inference which does not leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans. Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason. Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-10/china-ai-leaders-warn-of-widening-gap-with-us-after-1b-ipo-week

* Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand. Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html

* You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI’s reported revenue numbers. OpenAI is already at $20b/year in revenue and without monetizing their free users. In 2024, their revenue grew by 2.5x. In 2025, their revenue grew by 4x. So it's not slowing down. If they grow 4x again in 2026, they're already at $80b/year in revenue. Sources: https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-revenue https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-openai-will-top-20-billion-annual-revenue-this-year.html

Notice how compute is always followed by ""demand"". It's real demand. It's not a circular economy. It's truly real user demand. 

Listen to people actually are close to AI demand. They're all saying they're compute constrained. Literally everyone does not have enough compute. Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropic's Claude models because Anthropic simply does not have enough compute to meet demand. 

**So why is demand increasing?**

* Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit, AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level. Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency. Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether it's ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support.

* Models are getting smarter faster. It’s not slowing down. It’s accelerating. In the last 6 months, GPT5, Gemini 3, and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected. The intelligence graph is now exponential, not linear. Source 1: https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks Source 2: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard

* There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again. GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100-class chips. The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs.

* LLMs aren't just chat bots anymore. They're trading stocks, doing automated analysis, writing apps from scratch, solving previously unsolved math conjectures, and is already showing signs of self improvement (read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement). The token usage has exploded. If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails, you are truly missing the forest for the trees. 

* AI models are becoming so smart that they’re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems. Here’s Terence Tao, one of the smartest humans alive, explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem: https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103

Here is the lowdown on why I'm loading up at **$13.85**.

# They still own the ""Cool"" part of Boston Dynamics

Hyundai gets all the headlines, but SoftBank still holds a **20% stake**. At CES 2026, the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for real-world work. If Boston Dynamics goes public, that 20% stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke.

# They have ""Skin in the Game"" everywhere

Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank has built an AI empire. They aren't just betting on one horse; they own the whole track. From the chips (ARM) to the brains (OpenAI) to the muscle (Robotics), they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack.

# The Price is a Steal

$SFTBY is trading around **$14**, down from its highs of $20+. While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection, SoftBank is trading at a massive discount. It’s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat.

# They’re back on ""Offense""

Masa Son (the CEO) recently signaled they are done playing defense. With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure, they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the ""AI re-rating"" this year.

# The Bottom Line

If you think robotics and AI are the next trillion-dollar themes, SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap. The risk? It’s volatile. The reward? Asymmetric as hell.

It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search.

In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact.

Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out.

If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player.

But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets.

Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, hell even Sephora. Feels like something will stick.

TLDR: AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.","UBER fears caused by AVs is the same story as Seaech Ai fears was for Google

But with Waymo hitting over 14 million trips in 2025 and expanding to more urban centres in 2026 there’s clearly a heap of operational momentum there.

What I can’t figure out is how Uber maintains its current valuation in an autonomous driving world? Seems like we’re definitely headed that way. And currently Uber takes a cut of the drivers fee by providing access to a pool of riders, while the driver provides the car, time, bears the risk, etc. If AV’s displace drivers, and since Uber doesn’t have its own self driving tech, then it would have to licence that tech or buy the cars that had it installed. 

But in that same world, the developer of that tech (Waymo / Google) would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself (no licensing).

I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment, but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app. When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper, safer option (both supported by current data).

But in that same world, the developer of that tech (Waymo / Google) would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself (no licensing).

I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment, but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app. When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper, safer option (both supported by current data).

I’m sure I’m getting this wrong somehow or thinking about it wrong so keen to hear others thoughts on all this.",11,0.74,16,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qboi6a/uber_vs_waymo_google/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qboi6a/uber_vs_waymo_google/,neutral,Analytical question about future prospects

This shit didn’t prevent $GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today. Clearly, we cannot expect a $4-trillion company to grow by another Doble. However, the deepening of NVIDIA's cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size.

Which ONE ? $LLY is indeed the ""king of industrialization"" of AI pharmaceuticals, and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $1 billion, but there will be no surprises if it is already Prcie in, and I won't go to places with a lot of people.

$ILMN is indeed a good alternative, it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution, and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider, and its business model is transforming to high-profit software and services, but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in.

So, who will be the next target for capital inflow? I belive $RXRX is the best choice. 

It is not crowded at present, has stopped falling in the low demand zone, and its share price is also reasonable. Once the rotation reaches $RXRX, there is still a chance to double at least.

I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to ""rationalize"" away.

So this year, I decided to record and publish every ""buy"" in my mind throughout the year, along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision (and timestamp the day of the call). In order to systematize the process, I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly. 

Winners would be categorized as up more than 5% throughout the period.

Neutral picks are within 5% up or down (dead money, or recent calls mainly).

Losers were tagged as greater than a 5% loss.

All picks (regardless of June or December timestamp) would be equally weighted.

An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances.

**The Results:**

I ended up writing 35 ""calls"" between April and December 2025. Price on the day I published vs today. No edits. No pretending I sold the top. No “would’ve sized this differently.” Just the equal weight returns.

Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly **42%**.

**Winners/Neutral/Losers**

* **Up more than 5%:** **18 / 35 (51%)**
* **Neutral (±5%):** **5 / 35 (14%)**
* **Down more than 5%:** **12 / 35 (34%)**

Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy:

Diversification among convicted buys is not optional for stock pickers. Yes, a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out, but some flat out did not and were anchors to the portfolio. 

Even if you are ""right"" over the long term, you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost, timing matters. 

Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance. One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come. (even at a 1/35th allocation)

**A handful of names did almost all the work.** 

JMIA (+478%)

RKLB (+288%)

HOOD (+167%)

AMD (+143%)

SOFI (+142%). 

**A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns:**

HNST (-52%)

BMNR (-49%)

COIN (-21%)

HIMS (-21%)

MELI (-17%)

PYPL (-16%)

**Another important point of discovery:** Going against the common sentiment in a stock, is right a heck of a lot more than it's wrong. My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year (AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand), Estee Lauder Stock trading as if it's going to file bankruptcy, the death of Google by chatgpt, so on and so forth. 

**Lastly,** although not being able ""to sell"" certainly cost me real performance over this experiment, it also helped immensely with discipline. Not panic selling long-term convictions over a headline and inversely not selling the first 15% pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times. 

**Yes,** there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry, but it's often much later than you think. 

Overall, it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026. Regardless of the returns or bull market luck, I became an immensely better investor throughout the process.

the math: We're getting $61B worth of Bitcoin for a $45-48B valuation. That's a 20-25%+ discount to fair NAV, something that almost NEVER happens with MSTR.

Historically it trades at massive premiums (50-100%+) because of Saylor's leverage genius, future acquisition potential, and the ""Bitcoin yield"" play.

But right now? After the recent volatility, unrealized loss noise, and all the MSCI FUD, the market seems like the biggest bargain in years. MSCI backed off full delisting and confirmed retention (with some new share caps), which removed the forced-selling overhang and sparked relief pump last week. Yet the stock still hasn't fully repriced the true value.

Add in the fact they just stacked another 1,286 BTC early Jan, boosted cash reserves to $2.25B, probably ready for more buys, this discount won't last once BTC pushes back toward $100k+.

# Why Loyalty Programmes Matter

Airlines only fly planes to get to those air mile profits. It's ungodly.

Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $12BN when their market cap was $7BN. These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need. ALK has $2BN of debt secured against theirs.

So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly, investors should pay very close attention.

If this behaviour is not openly discussed and disclosed, but is eased into financial statements without comment, investors should get away first and ask questions later.

# The Sparkling Diamond: Credit Card Partnerships

The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership. Alaska is tied to Bank of America. Here's how it works:

Bank of America uses Alaska's miles to induce customers to use their credit cards. When a customer earns miles, Alaska bills Bank of America immediately. The exact numbers aren't disclosed, but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays.

When Alaska receives this cash, here's how it's accounted for:

The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance - not the cost, the fair value. Per Alaska's 2023 10-K (the last time it was disclosed), this is about 0.75 cents per mile. This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability.

The remaining 0.50 cents? That goes straight into ""Loyalty Other Revenue"" - i.e. profit - because there are no further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents.

This is a stable, predictable relationship. I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022. Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies, but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent.

Until Q2 2025.

In Q2 2025, Alaska's issuance-to-revenue ratio deviated 10.40 standard deviations from its historical baseline.

This isn't the universe ending though statistically it would be. This is a ratio that has completely broken down.

There is $180M of liability (points issued) with no corresponding loyalty revenue. The points appeared on the books, but the profit that should accompany them did not.

The temptation to grasp at Alaska's recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some re-balancing of the two programmes is irresistible. But where is the expense recorded? Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting? Not there either.

Now look at the other side of the balance sheet. Receivables from Affinity Card Partners (read: Bank of America) jumped from $111M to $306M in a single quarter. Something has happened here. Some similar transactions have occurred. You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure.

There is none.

# The Sneaky Restatement

That's not all that happened in Q2. Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10-Q, we find this rather vague statement:

Every character in that note is drafted to make you think: ""This doesn't concern me."" And if you did dig, you'd have a hard time finding what changed. It's two pages away from the affected number.

What changed? They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $58M - a 49% revision.

Why? No explanation. Just... cute.

# Where Did the Money Go?

Let's see what washed out in Q3.

Receivables from BofA dropped by $129M. You'd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected. But look at the operating cash flow statement. It's not there. No corresponding inflow.

Instead, $120M appeared in ""Other Non-Current Assets.""

What happened here? As an investor, I was confidently awaiting $120M in operating cash flow. Instead, all I know now is that as a non-current asset, there is no expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months.

No explanation whatsoever.

# Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too

There's more trouble in this loyalty programme.

When customers redeem miles, they can use them on Alaska's own aircraft or on partner airlines. On Alaska's own metal, the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway. But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash.

In Q2 and Q3 2025, something extraordinary is happening. The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward - which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme.

In Q2 2025, Alaska's issuance-to-revenue ratio deviated 10.40 standard deviations from its historical baseline.

This isn't the universe ending though statistically it would be. This is a ratio that has completely broken down.

There is $180M of liability (points issued) with no corresponding loyalty revenue. The points appeared on the books, but the profit that should accompany them did not.

The temptation to grasp at Alaska's recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some re-balancing of the two programmes is irresistible. But where is the expense recorded? Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting? Not there either.

Now look at the other side of the balance sheet. Receivables from Affinity Card Partners (read: Bank of America) jumped from $111M to $306M in a single quarter. Something has happened here. Some similar transactions have occurred. You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure.

There is none.

# The Sneaky Restatement

That's not all that happened in Q2. Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10-Q, we find this rather vague statement:

Every character in that note is drafted to make you think: ""This doesn't concern me."" And if you did dig, you'd have a hard time finding what changed. It's two pages away from the affected number.

What changed? They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $58M - a 49% revision.

Why? No explanation. Just... cute.

# Where Did the Money Go?

Let's see what washed out in Q3.

Receivables from BofA dropped by $129M. You'd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected. But look at the operating cash flow statement. It's not there. No corresponding inflow.

Instead, $120M appeared in ""Other Non-Current Assets.""

What happened here? As an investor, I was confidently awaiting $120M in operating cash flow. Instead, all I know now is that as a non-current asset, there is no expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months.

No explanation whatsoever.

# Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too

There's more trouble in this loyalty programme.

When customers redeem miles, they can use them on Alaska's own aircraft or on partner airlines. On Alaska's own metal, the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway. But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash.

In Q2 and Q3 2025, something extraordinary is happening. The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward - which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme.

CEO Jensen Huang is now pushing beyond data center AI into physical world applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and AI powered assistants, aiming to embed Nvidia’s hardware and software at every layer of the next AI wave. With record revenue ($57B in a single quarter), a $500B+ order backlog through 2026, with indications from Jensen Huang that this number may actually have increased further resulting from developments since it was first announced, deep partnerships (OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens), and new chips like Vera Rubin in full production, Nvidia is positioning itself to sustain dominance even amid what many believe are overblown bubble concerns. Key risks remain geopolitical, especially China export controls although the recent developments there appear positive.

Nvidia’s strategy is a deliberate shift from being the AI infrastructure supplier, which they still dominate, to becoming a de facto platform owner for machine intelligence. By tying chips, software, simulation tools, and industry partnerships together, Nvidia is reducing customer optionality. Once a carmaker, factory, or robot fleet standardizes on Nvidia’s stack, switching costs rise sharply. This makes Nvidia less exposed to an eventual slowdown in AI model training spend and more leveraged to long duration, recurring demand from autonomous systems and industrial deployment. In effect, Nvidia is anchoring itself to physical capital cycles (cars, factories, robots), which evolve more slowly but are harder to displace once embedded which should help reduce eventual true downward pressure when an AI bubble in fact makes an appearance.

I’ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market. With the rise of Waymo and Tesla’s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber, Lyft, and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gonna be in this market. I’m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be.


Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere. I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse. The horse was the main way of transportation, everyone owned one. Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car. Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses.  This is how car ownership will be. 

The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver. Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it’s going to be a huge benefit to everyone. We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day. If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides. There’s no point in owning a car. It saves way more than buying a 30k car, insurance and having the liability of owning a car. 

Now the question is who’s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation. 

The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end. Think of uber now, like Netflix In the 2010s. They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming. As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing. The second phase of this is starting  for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate. We already saw the hbo merger drama. 

That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion.  Tesla, Waymo, uber, Lyft  maybe more in the future are going to be the major players. I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall. They will  end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft, while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated. This could also play out the reverse direction (seems less likely) also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers. 

This will ultimately leave 4-10ish players dominating consumer logistics. 


The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate (more likely Waymo and Tesla) and wipes everyone else out. I think it’s already too competitive of a space for this to happen. 

As this story progress we will see companies that haven’t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said: 

Overall I’m bullish, on Waymo, Tesla, uber, maybe Lyft. I don’t see a great future for ford, GM ECT

How Counterpart AI (Clover AI) is supposed to work.

Example patient:

72-year-old with diabetes (DM) and heart failure (CHF)

(Step 1): Risk identification

The system reviews existing data like:

•	Medical records (EHR)

•	Medication history and refills

•	Prior ER or hospital visits

Based on patterns, the patient is flagged as higher risk for a future hospitalization.

(Step 2): In-visit prompt

During a regular appointment, the doctor may see a short note such as:

“Heart failure (CHF) risk trending upward consider labs, medication review, and adherence check.”

Nothing replaces clinical judgment. It’s more of a reminder than an alert.

(Step 3): Care team follow-up

If needed:

•	The medical doctor adjusts medications

•	A registered nurse handles follow-ups

•	A registered pharmacist helps simplify meds or check adherence

The idea is that everyone focuses on the same high-risk patients instead of spreading effort evenly.

(Step 4): Prevention

By catching issues earlier:

•	Some ER visits may be avoided

•	Fewer hospital admissions

•	Better continuity of care

Lower costs are a side effect, not the main action.

(Why)

Why clinicians might actually use something like this

•	Less time digging through charts

•	Clearer prioritization of patients

•	Works within existing workflows

In value-based care models, incentives are often tied to outcomes rather than volume.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The top court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, as it has scheduled January 9 as an “opinion day”- the first chance for a ruling on Trump tariffs. The court does not announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue. Media reports highlight that the US Supreme Court generally releases decisions around 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on opinion days.

The US Supreme Court will now give its verdict on whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs without Congress's approval.

Practical and economic implications :

The stakes of the Supreme Court’s decision extend far beyond legal theory. The tariffs imposed under IEEPA have generated billions of dollars in revenue4 and have had a significant impact on global trade relationships. If the Court invalidates these tariffs, many companies will likely seek refunds, creating substantial administrative and financial challenges for the government. Moreover, the ruling could alter the dynamics of trade negotiations, as the threat of swift, sweeping tariffs has been a powerful tool in bringing other countries to the bargaining table.

Notably, certain tariffs – such as those imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act 1974 – would remain unaffected by the Court’s decision. These authorities provide alternative mechanisms for the administration to pursue its trade and national security objectives, albeit with more targeted and procedurally defined tools.

The tariffs imposed last year amounted to an average tax increase of $1,100 per U.S. household last year and are seen at $1,400 this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank. It estimated that those numbers would shrink to $300 in 2025 and $400 this year if the IEEPA tariffs go away.

The court's decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trump's tariffs. It could, for example, narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit, Morgan Stanley's policy strategists wrote earlier this week. It could also give the administration a ""grace period"" to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place.

And even if tariffs are fully scaled back, the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels.

Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon, one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors, if the company did not end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity.

Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry, yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eye-popping salaries to top executives.

""Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,"" Trump said on social media.

Alphabet ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street after putting together the pieces for its AI comeback.

CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. On Alphabet’s October earnings call, he said that Google’s cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined.

Meanwhile, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry’s AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022.

I just want to share thoughts on how I am hedging for what I think is going to be an AI bubble burst. again, this is not financial advice, I am a monkey randomly hitting buttons here, and will soon resort to avian augury to divine my path through the market. anyways. 

  
generally, I think tech and anything AI especially are in a bubble right now. their market value keeps going up, and their use generally is staying the same, if not optically decreasing- to that last point, more are more people are starting to see what is and what is not vaporware in the ai space now, and understand the limitations and value proposition of ai than they did a few years ago when this all started. AI has uses, but when I say AI in terms of the bubble and industry, I am talking about generative AI. I think that AI is one of the tools of the future, just not the pure generative kind. machine learning, and other forms of AI that we have been developing for a long time are, I think, where the long term bet is at vis a vis AI as a stable market force rather than AI the generative AI industry. 

to that end, I do have positions in TSMC, as I believe that regardless of where the tech industry goes, they, other fabs, and the people who supply them will be the ultimate winners of this bubble, and they who will lose the least when the dust settles. 

Venezuela does put a slight damper in my ""the US wouldn't be that impatient, and china is way too patient, right?"" mantra about Taiwan and TSMC, but I'm convinced Venezuela is an oil play, and the orange man hates anything to do with computers or people who he can't bully. 

politics aside, I think that companies like NVDIA and AMD will still be businesses after the dust settles, as long as NVDIA isn't doing an ENRON, but I just dont see their moat as impenetrable. and even if it is, is it protecting as big a hoard as they thing? we saw with deepseek that there are efficiency improvements to be found, which could seriously cut into NVDIA's bottom line. 

it is only a matter of time until the market has to reckon with the fact that generative AI just does not do what we want it to do. it is not worth trillions of dollars at the moment in terms of return on investment. days, months, years, I'm not sure, but here are the things I think that are actually making the world a different, better place, and will change the world. basically, good things to invest in, for better, or for worse, that are not AI. 

  
Geospatial tech. I think things like LIDAR, improved GIS networks, long range networks and network access are going to become huge.  they already are, but they represent incredible breakthroughs in how we understand the world, and how we interact with it. also huge for how companies provide services

BIOMED- Crispr and mRNA (and similar) vaccines and therapies, and the combination therein. right now the main thing holding these incredible technologies back from being something super commonplace in medicine is 

1.  no real regulation on using it on embryos and fetuses, or about engineering embryos  (there is a ban, but at some point, we will have to address the reality of the probability of use while trying to figure out what is medicine and what is eugenics- quite the sticky wicket, wouldn't you say, since it could both very rapidly add to or detract from human genetic diversity in ways that are impossible to predict, except that they have the potential to alter the evolutionary course of Homo sapiens and everything else on this planet)
2. the process of using it now, though effective, is brutal, and limited I think that the recent sickle cell cure requires someone with sickle cell anemia to undergo bone marrow removal, chemo and radiation, and then the marrow is replaced? I dont know, but it sounds like something not everyone will be able to undergo yet, unfortunately. 
3. its so expensive. so so so expensive. millions of dollars for individualized treatment expensive. insurance may or may not cover it expensive. 
4. the political climate in many of the wealthiest developed nations vis a vis vaccines and biomedical breakthroughs is not favorable. it is setting us back years or decades from cures. 

chips and batteries- I dont know about large scale 50000k a pop chips but more and more computer chips are going in more and more things. I mean lego just chipped the brick. so my guess is more chips, and eventually, AI integration into things that people actually want to/like to use en masse. that means more battery life being used by the average device. ...[truncated]","hedging the impending AI doom bubble

I'd like to share my thoughts. Although SpaceX is well-positioned in the rapidly developing aerospace industry, both SpaceX and Elon Musk have repeatedly stated that they have no plans to go public in the short term. They believe that an IPO would create short-term performance pressure, which would be detrimental to their long-term, high-risk space goals (especially the Mars program). SpaceX will only go public after substantial progress has been made on the Mars program. In my opinion, SpaceX doesn't lack funding; it collaborates with several private equity firms and national defense agencies. Its current valuation has already reached super-unicorn levels. A SpaceX IPO is not a matter of time, but a strategic decision. Of course, Starlink could also go public separately, and I believe the likelihood of a Starlink IPO is far higher than that of SpaceX. Therefore, I am very optimistic about Starlink's short-term prospects.

Hyundai unveiled the production version of ‍the Atlas humanoid robot, ‍developed by its ‍unit Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The company did not disclose the volume or cost of the robots, but said in a ‌statement ‌it aims to roll out adoption across all ​of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “physical AI”.

The robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028, with applications expanding gradually as safety and quality benefits ⁠are validated, it said.

By 2030, Hyundai said Atlas robots were expected to move into component assembly with a longer-term plan to take on tasks involving heavy loads, repetitive motions and complex operations across production sites.

The robots are designed to reduce physical strain on workers by taking on higher-risk and repetitive tasks, laying the groundwork for broader commercial use in industrial settings, it said.

At Hyundai Motor’s affiliate Kia Corp, the labor union last year called to establish a body to address potential labour rights issues in preparation for the AI era, as workers raised concerns about expanding automation.

The company expects humanoid robots to become the ‍largest segment of the physical artificial intelligence market, which refers to AI systems ‌embedded in hardware that collect real-world data and make ⁠autonomous decisions, spanning areas such as robotics, smart factories and autonomous driving.

Atlas features human-scale hands with tactile sensing and has the ‍ability to lift up to 50 kg (110 pounds), according to Hyundai.

The robot can operate autonomously and is designed to function in industrial environments ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius.

Hyundai said it is accelerating development in this area through partnerships with global AI leaders, ⁠including a collaboration with Nvidia and Google, ‌aimed at improving safety, efficiency and real-world deployment.

I’m 16 and want to start investing long term with my dad’s help (we set up a trading 212 account). I’ve saved around €2,000 and after reading through this sub and researching, my goal is to mostly hold index etfs and let compounding do its thing.

I was thinking of starting with something like 80% in index etfs and 20% in stocks/ silver gold (to gain some experience and practice, i wont die losing this money)  but im stuck on a few things

firstly, im an EU resident and while everyones praising VOO, the europan alternative VUAA has only went up 3% over the past year so would it still be a good choice long term? then i was thinking of some global etf to diversify. if u could reccomend me any specific etfs/ stocks i would be thankful

to sum up does this kind of setup make sense?

would you change anything? which stocks would u reccomend for the buggest compounding since i domt plan on touching the money (in etfs) for a long time only adding more monthly/ bimonthly based on my situation. Thanks a lot  for any advice

also im scared since people say the markets very high right now is that okay?","16yo starting long-term investing with €2k – does this portfolio make sense?

BUT, I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could #TimeTheMarket (sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later).

1. Those of you getting really lucky remember that, like trust, a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you aren't careful. Or...

Currently I have my checking account with Capital One and I do both my savings as well as investing with Sofi (High APY+ I love their UI). I have a part time job where I make minimum wage, so I'm not exactly talking about significant amounts of money, just a few thousands. I live with my parents still so my only expenses turn out to about $60 a month + whatever I spent on food or entertainment.

I think I just feel a little lost especially hearing from different sources across the web as well as not fully understanding my own investment goals yet. Right now the main thing I'd like to save/invest for is my first car, as well as money for travel because I love to travel and I'd like to see as much of the world as possible while I have my youth. Longer term, I wouldn't mind having that safety net which long term investment could provide for me. More specifically, I also might use some savings sometime down the line to help finance a short film project since I am a film major and early on self financing is one of the only ways really you can get your stuff off the ground. As well, (sorry I keep adding stuff) I'm in community college right now and may transfer so it would be nice to have some money to help my parents out in case I do in a few years. So I guess my horizon would be in the 5-10 year range but I also wouldn't mind holding for decades to see that return later on in life.

So I have most of my money in savings right now where I currently have a 4% APY with Sofi because of the 0.7% boost to new Sofi+ subscribers (eligible deposit). I have a decent amount of my money in stocks however, with a good portion of it (around 60%) in VOO. I also have NVDA, IREN (I hope the bubble doesn't burst), and TTWO (GTA 6 lol). As well, I also started off with one of those Robo invest accounts Sofi has but I have a lot less money in there (1/5 the amount of self-investment) is it worth it to even continue that one? It currently has a 0.25% advisory fee and I'm getting modest ROI though a bit lower than the self directed one. It's on moderately aggressive and I've been debating setting it to aggressive. Right now I just kind of feel like I don't know what I'm doing I see a lot of people online saying ""VOO and chill"" but I'm just wondering whether that's the best option specifically considering my horizon such as wanting a car by this year. I just kind of look at the funny line that goes up and down and say ""that looks good!"" lmao. But seriously I just don't know if I'm doing this right and whether I should diversify more or go for riskier stocks or I'm not sure what. I'd say my risk tolerance is pretty good, I don't get super scared when I see a slight downturn but of course I feel a bit of a twinge of panic when that happens. But still, I think I might have diamond hands haha.

Also a few things I was wondering about would it be good to buy Gold right now I've seen videos that it's kind of skyrocketing due to increased mistrust in USD. Along those lines, would it be smart to continue buying VOO as it only represents American S&P 500? I know the US market won't crumble overnight or anything I'm just wondering if it would be smart to look into international ETF's and stocks. Also, I find dividends slightly interesting is it worth looking at dividends and dividend investing for some passive income?

While I'm no MBA I do have prior experience in stock markets, investing, options, crypto and other tools, but I played with fire some years ago (LUNA flashbacks) and basically chickened out of crypto and investments all together, especially since I lost my job a year ago.

I now have a stable good paying job and I can invest around $100-$120 USD monthly ($117,23 this month), and decided to build a rather safe and conservative portfolio consisting off: 35% in SPDR 500, 15% each in VTI and QQQ, 5% each in KO, JNJ, and AAPL, 7% in MSFT, and 6% each in NVDA, AMZN, and META.

I did some math and corroborated this info with some help of AI and apparently I would be getting between 5% and 15% returns annually including dividends (can be more if the market goes bullish).

Any advise? Any changes I should do? Do you think this portfolio is good? All help will be highly appreciated!",8,0.69,13,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q4umy7/back_to_investing_after_years_off_the_markets/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q4umy7/back_to_investing_after_years_off_the_markets/,positive,Optimistic about investing and seeking advice.

Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion.

# BNPL vs Credit Cards

Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything.

If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc.

Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice.

The CFPB finds that ""BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.""

BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting.

Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by ""improved credit models"" and ""shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.""

This is SEZL exact model.

# Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided

A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc.

**Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself.

**Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven.

Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted.

Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s.

Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL.

They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance.

Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage.

====================================================================

We recently got news of Maduro's capture by the US, and this is very economically important, and it's extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market.

**Background:**

*Note: Use of AI to research & write the sanction background summary. (Reviewed by me)*

**2018**

* The Trump administration **expanded financial sanctions** on Venezuela.
* New executive orders **banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt** and blocked dealings with Venezuela’s **state-issued digital currency (the “petro”)**.
* Goal: **cut off new financing** to Nicolás Maduro’s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally.

**2019**

* January\*\*:\*\* The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, effectively **blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil** and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S.
* August\*\*:\*\* The U.S. **froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States** and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro.
* Impact: Venezuela’s **oil exports and government revenues collapsed**, making 2019 the most severe sanctions year.

====================================================================

**Goodyear Tires ($GT) Update:**

**December 10, 2018:** Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions. They locked the gates and laid off the workforce. (1,160 employees)

**December 11, 2018 (The Seizure):** The Maduro regime declared Goodyear's closure ""illegal"" and an act of ""sabotage."" The government invoked labor laws to immediately ""occupy"" and take control of the facility in Valencia, promising to restart production under state management.

In a famous detail from the 2018 exit, Goodyear gave each laid-off employee **10 tires** as part of their severance package because the currency (Bolívar) was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money. *(AI)*

If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant, Goodyear gains a fully-constructed industrial facility. Even if it requires $100M in refurbishment, reclaiming a facility with a value of \~$500M+ is a huge gain for Goodyear, so I'll try to quantify this the best I can.

Before the complete economic collapse, Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America. We can look at 2014-2015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain.

* In 2014, despite early signs of crisis, Goodyear Venezuela generated **$119 million in Operating Income**.
* In 2015, Venezuela accounted for **33% of Latin America’s net sales that year,** up from 16% in 2014, despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession.
* At the time of the 2018 seizure, union leaders reported the plant was producing **10,500 tires per day** while running at only **20% capacity**.
   * This implies a full capacity of 52,500 tires/day or 19m tires/yr (LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013)

Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream, particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime, would represent a massive gain for Goodyear’s current shareholders.

**The Valencia Plant**

On September 16, 2025, the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million (approximately $32 million) to ""reactivate and modernize"" the Valencia plant. 

This investment was directed toward:   

1. Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems.   
2. Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle state-of-the-art machinery.   
3. Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards.   
4. Modernization of curing and extrusion set-points to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs. 

It is likely focused on the most critical failure points, curing presses and Banbury mixers.

If this plant was worth \~$USD600m in 2018, it was state-of-the art at the time, ill conservatively (see note below) estimate \~200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013's demand alone.

1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over  the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. 

2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. 

3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless.

4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. 

5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR…

Personally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall.

Oil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years.

First of all, what does Meta do? We all know it for its social media (IG, Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads), which have an incredible 3.5 billion users daily. It's practically a monopoly, but officially it hasn't been deemed such, so we're safe.

They generate incredible cash flow and advertise themselves, but we'll see about that later. Furthermore, even if it seems like Meta has fallen behind in certain hot sectors, that's not the case. They've actually launched into AI development (Meta AI, the one integrated into their platforms, which may seem behind but has 1 billion downloads), AR, and VR with products like Meta Quest and the new Ray-Ban sunglasses.

But let's take a step back: how does Meta make money? How does it spend? Debt? Cash? Let's analyze the Q3 2025 balance sheet

Total revenue: $51.24 billion (+26% YoY)
Family of Apps (FB, IG, WA, Messenger): $50.8 billion (99% of total)
Almost all from advertising: $50.1 billion (+26% YoY)
Ad impressions +14%
Average price per ad +10%
Reality Labs (VR/AR/Quest/glasses): only $470 million (+74% YoY)
What do we learn? It earns almost all its revenue from ads on social apps, which generates a constant cash flow.

Total expenses Q3: $30.71 billion (+32% YoY)
Main items: salaries, infrastructure, legal, depreciation
Guidance for full-year 2025 expenses: $116-118 billion (+22-24% YoY)
Capex Q3: $19.37 billion
Guidance for full-year 2025 Capex: $70-72 billion (huge for AI data centers, GPUs, infrastructure)
Where the big cash is going:

AI infrastructure (data centers, compute)
Reality Labs losses: ~$4-5 billion per quarter
Buybacks & Dividends
The company is spending heavily on future products that are still losing money.

Cash & marketable securities (September 30, 2025): $44.45 billion
Long-term debt: $28.83 billion (stable, not pumping debt)
Net cash: +$15.6 billion (cash > debt)
Q3 free cash flow: $10.63 billion (positive despite crazy capex)
I'd like to point out that last quarter's earnings were drastically reduced due to some occasional tax payments.

In my opinion, I see an opportunity here: despite being an already established company with a generous market cap of 1.64T, I believe it could still yield significant potential (we've seen the rise of even larger companies like Alphabet or Nvidia). While it's accumulating cash with minimal expenses through social media ads, which are now (fortunately or unfortunately) ingrained in our daily lives, it's investing mountains of money (which it earns regularly and without debt) in innovative sectors and products with significant growth potential, which could eventually dominate their industry.

It hasn't had incredible performances lately; compared to its sector peers, it performed much less strongly last year, even less than the SP500 (which could be an advantage; for once, we're not buying at the highs). It currently has a P/E ratio of 29, which isn't particularly low, but I urge you to look for something less overvalued in the current market, especially in the tech sector. If there were to be a retracement or even a bear market in 2026, as some claim, Meta should be less affected, being already closer to its fair value.

So, I'm thinking about it. Do you already have any shares or options? What do you think?

Obviously, this isn't financial advice; do your research before deciding.","$META has a huge potential

Capex Q3: $19.37 billion
Guidance for full-year 2025 Capex: $70-72 billion (huge for AI data centers, GPUs, infrastructure)
Where the big cash is going:

AI infrastructure (data centers, compute)
Reality Labs losses: ~$4-5 billion per quarter
Buybacks & Dividends
The company is spending heavily on future products that are still losing money.

Cash & marketable securities (September 30, 2025): $44.45 billion
Long-term debt: $28.83 billion (stable, not pumping debt)
Net cash: +$15.6 billion (cash > debt)
Q3 free cash flow: $10.63 billion (positive despite crazy capex)
I'd like to point out that last quarter's earnings were drastically reduced due to some occasional tax payments.

In my opinion, I see an opportunity here: despite being an already established company with a generous market cap of 1.64T, I believe it could still yield significant potential (we've seen the rise of even larger companies like Alphabet or Nvidia). While it's accumulating cash with minimal expenses through social media ads, which are now (fortunately or unfortunately) ingrained in our daily lives, it's investing mountains of money (which it earns regularly and without debt) in innovative sectors and products with significant growth potential, which could eventually dominate their industry.

It hasn't had incredible performances lately; compared to its sector peers, it performed much less strongly last year, even less than the SP500 (which could be an advantage; for once, we're not buying at the highs). It currently has a P/E ratio of 29, which isn't particularly low, but I urge you to look for something less overvalued in the current market, especially in the tech sector. If there were to be a retracement or even a bear market in 2026, as some claim, Meta should be less affected, being already closer to its fair value.

So, I'm thinking about it. Do you already have any shares or options? What do you think?

Prices are high, tech runs the show, and everyone’s talking about AI. But the reality today is very different than 2000, especially when you look under the hood.

Back in the dot com bubble, a huge chunk of companies had no profits at all. A lot of them didn’t even have real products. They were valued based on clicks, website traffic, or just the idea that “the internet is the future.” When money got tighter, those companies had nothing to fall back on. They ran out of cash and went to zero.

Today’s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon. These aren’t hype machines. They generate real profits every single quarter. Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then.

Another big difference is how important tech is now. In 2000, tech was optional. Today it’s infrastructure. Cloud services, chips, software, and data centers run basically everything. Governments, hospitals, banks, and the military all depend on this stuff. That demand doesn’t disappear just because the economy slows down.

That doesn’t mean stocks can’t drop. They absolutely can. High prices usually mean lower returns and more volatility. But a drop today would likely be about valuations coming down, not companies blowing up.

The dot com crash was about fake businesses failing. Today’s market is about real businesses being priced aggressively. That’s a big difference that gets lost in the headlines.

SpaceX stock debut is the big market event of 2026. Why Musk’s venture could be biggest IPO ever","As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record.

 Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion.

 SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019.

Wall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood.

SpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year.

Analyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink.

Lin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. 

“In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. 

To be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. 

A bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year.","Pro Analysis

Going into the first trading day of 2026, TSLA was up \~2% in premarket, and it really looked like it might finally make a run at the $500 psychological level. Sentiment felt bullish, risk‑on vibes, new year optimism， all of it.



Then the market opened… and it completely fell apart.



Instead of follow‑through, the stock sold off hard, flipping from +2% premarket to around ‑3% intraday. No momentum, no support, just straight selling pressure.

This is my thesis on a medium to long-term, long position on $FUN","I submitted my thesis over at Value Investors Club, which is hyper-critical of write-ups. While the admins appreciated the submission, it wasn't approved, so I'm posting it here:

**Basic Overview**

Six Flags Entertainment Corp (NYSE: $FUN) is a special turnaround case currently trading, what I believe undeservedly, at pandemic lows. Before the pandemic, the last time it traded at this price was in 2011. This suggests that the market believes $FUN is in a terminal decline on the brink of bankruptcy. On paper, this might be understandable: Their TTM income is -472M, they have a total debt of nearly $5B, and a market cap of $1.87B. However, investors are paying 10x on EV/EBITDA, suggesting they might be optimistic about the company's future, and the company is giving guidance that EV/EBITDA is 6x, normalized, implying value. 

Six Flags has massive brand recognition. Even if you've never been to Six Flags before, most Americans know about Six Flags and likely know somebody who has been to one in their lifetime. Six Flags Entertainment also owns theme parks that aren't under their ""Six Flags"" name, so there are many people that go to their local park not necessarily aware they're attending a Six Flags Entertainment park. However, their brand hasn't changed much over the last 30+ years, and its reputation isn't the best. Former-CEO Selim Bassoul said the park became a ""cheap day-care center for teenagers"". The food isn't high quality, the parks and amenities are dirty, and there's a perception of lower safety (despite that not being statistically true). Wealthier families tend to favor flying to Disney or Universal over regional Six Flags trips. 

A possible dark horse is the company's unutilized real estate asset base. They sit on a ton of real estate, a lot of it is unutilized, therefore not generating revenue (or not being monetized in a significant way). A 2022 article from Land & Buildings Investment Management claimed that Six Flags owned property in 17 of its parks ""worth more than the stock value of the company"". In 2022, FUN traded at between $40-60/share. According to Six Flags' 2024 Form 10-K, several parks are on land that is leased, implying that the land is already monetized, but what's even more interesting is that there's at least 2,070 acres of identifiable surplus land, probably more. This unutilized land can be used for hotels, restaurants, shops, and more pleasures beyond the typical theme park. If it were me, I'd quickly turn the lowest value land into a solar farm for the park. 

**JANA Partners Investment**

In October of 2025, JANA Partners took a 9% stake in $FUN, approximately $200M. JANA Partners are ""activist investors"". Their entire model is to do extensive research to identify undervalued companies, collaborate with them to create asymmetric upside, then get out when their job is done. JANA's most notable investments in the last decade:

1. Whole Foods: 8.8% stake, pushed for board changes and tech upgrades. Their pressure led to Amazon's acquisition for $13.7B.

2. PetSmart: 10% stake, pushed for sale due to poor performance and sold to BC Partners for $8.7B.

3. ConAgra: 7.2% stake, pushed for board changes and operational improvements. Added former Nestle CEO and Walgreens executive to the board.

4. Tiffany & Co.: 5.1% stake, appointed 3 new directors and improved brand strategy and governance.

5. Pinnacle Foods: 9.1% stake, pushed for cost cuts and strategic changes. Pinnacle was acquired by ConAgre for $8.1B.

Other activist investments include Qualcomm, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Walgreens Boot Alliance, Apache, Safeway, Ashland, McGraw Hill, Pinterest, and more.

Many people may have seen the headlines recently about the legendary, American Football tight-end, Travis Kelce's investment in FUN. He is also engaged to global music icon, Taylor Swift. Travis' investment was facilitated by JANA Partners. Aside from his legendary football status, he also has a podcast with his brother, another legendary football player. It's clear that JANA plans to leverage Kelce and his relations as a modern brand anchor, bridging sports and pop-culture among a younger demographic. His and his family's ability to reach the younger generation is insurmountable by nobody else in the world, in my opinion. 

**Turnaround Implementation and Difficulties**

The goals JANA listed included: revamping marketing/branding, improving technology and guest experience, assessing leadership and governance, reviewing potential acquisition or divestiture opportunities. JANA's managing partner, Scott Ostfeld, said there's ""substantial opportunity to drive improved park attendance and brand engagement through a re-energizing of its marketing and branding, emphasizing guest experience."" 

Their primary goal will likely be to fix Six Flag's reputation. I suspect they'll increase park prices (maybe dynamic pricing) and justify it by offering more premium food, app-based passes and ordering, better atmosphere, less crowd ...[truncated]","Six Flags ($FUN): A Turnaround or a Value Trap?

In the past few sessions we’ve seen:

• Equities pulling back across the board (S&P 500, Nasdaq, small caps)

• Precious metals showing sharp volatility rather than clean safe-haven flows

• Sudden intraday reversals instead of trend continuation

Gold briefly pushed toward the $5,000/oz zone before retracing, while silver saw an even more aggressive swing, spiking hard and then correcting just as fast. That kind of two-way volatility usually signals positioning stress rather than simple demand.

So what’s driving this synchronized pressure?

A few macro catalysts stand out:

1- Bond yield volatility

When long-end yields move fast, it tightens financial conditions. Equities reprice risk, while metals struggle with higher real yields.

2- Inflation uncertainty

Sticky inflation keeps rate-cut expectations unstable. Markets hate not knowing whether policy will ease or stay restrictive.

3- Liquidity rotation

When funds de-risk, they don’t always rotate cleanly into metals, sometimes they just raise cash.

4- Geopolitical & trade tensions

Tariff escalations and supply chain risks can be inflationary short-term but growth-negative long-term, a messy mix for all asset classes.

5- Positioning overcrowding

Both equities and metals had strong prior runs. When positioning gets crowded, even bullish assets correct together.

What’s interesting is that metals didn’t act as a pure hedge this time, they moved more like risk assets during the unwind before stabilizing. That divergence (or lack of safe-haven bid) could be signaling tighter liquidity conditions underneath.","When everything sells off at once… what’s the market really pricing in?

I like your explanation of market valuation.

Another perspective would be to think it terms of prices and trades. That's basically just money and securities changing hands. The price is simply dropping, because people agree to sell at a lower price.

Still, it's useful to ask ""where does the money go"", because the price dropping means people rather want to buy something else than what ever is dropping.

But since this primarily looks like sector based trimming, the answer could easily be ""anywhere else"".

Bond yields did drop, so some money did in fact flow into bonds. Also DXY isn't enough as it generally only looks at strong currencies. Cash could have flown into developing nations economies.

It could have also flowed into the real economy which would mean the sell off was largely retail driven, but I'm not sure retail owns enough to cause this. Could also be institutions shorting everything. Maybe they are expecting a pop in the dollar or they are trying to front run retail selling?

Could also be an evaporation of liquidity. 2008 style. Saw something similar at the start of Covid

It was an example to show that asset pricing isn’t a dollar for dollar trade off in gains/losses. Here’s a less drastic example:

If a stock is trading $200/share and something fundamentally changes in the intrinsic value of the company (commenter above used ponzi/fraud as an example), and now money managers are only willing to pay $100/share. Sellers didn’t cash out of that stock a dollar at time all the way down ($199, $198, $197…$100). The market price just gapped down 50% immediately. That perceived value was destroyed, but didn’t turn into cash.

This has always spooked me about growth stocks. In theory, if something crazy like a nuke launch happened, we could instantly see trillions of dollars just disappear into thin air.

What’s wild is how fast sentiment flipped. A week ago everyone felt comfortable chasing risk, and now even safe havens are moving nervously. Feels like markets are trying to price something we don’t fully see yet.

I decided early this morning to dump even my international holdings other than KXI and VYMI and kept a last minute buy of VDC yesterday afternoon.  Lost a small amount this morning but the long delayed correction might have come.  Too much debt, chaos in social and political worlds, bad economic policies and the discovering that AI needs to go back in the oven and BTC is not separated from stocks  and the silver and gold dump scares.  We in for it now.

I think the market is in a holding pattern until we get some clarity of how the Fed will work together and what the policy will look like after Warsh starts his term. Many of these markets are overcooked and overlevered so profit taking and chop ahead of that makes sense. Stocks look toppy as well. IMO, it will present some good buying opportunities between now and June.

The lethal combo of passive funds (ETFs) and stop-loss makes the whole market scream in unison.

It's literally a 5 trading day correction ffs. Jeeze there are a bunch of regards around here.

We will probably get 5 green days next week once the so called sector rotation stops.

Watch the market everyday for a few years and you don't react to this shit unless you have spare cash to invest.

The market gains a lot, runs out of steam, something triggers a capital flight temporarily to an undervalued sector, some people try to catch that train, the capital rotates back to the mega caps at a discount. A bunch of MM have made their regular profits needed, and start another green run in the real companies.

Tech is here to stay for sometime yet.

High beta assets are correlated and rise and fall together. 

This is literally the entire basis of CAPM and modern portfolio theory.

Always shocks me how many investors on reddit don’t even understand the most basic concepts…

Thr leverage in BTC was liquidated in the October gaffe. Although it can easily go down more.
Tough to ti.e a bottom. Good luck!

the company's fourth quarter financial results beat Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Fourth quarter revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion from the year-ago period, ahead of the $111.4 billion expected by analysts. The tech giant's earnings per share rose to $2.82 from $2.15 in the previous year, also higher than the $2.65 projected.

The jump in revenue was spurred by a 48% spike in Google Cloud revenue to $17.7 billion, more than the $16.2 billion expected by analysts.

Google Services — the segment including ad revenue from Search and YouTube, which accounts for the majority of Alphabet's revenue — saw revenue climb a more modest 14% from the previous year to $95.9 billion, higher than the projected $94.9 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Interesting to see how hard Google is leaning into AI and still putting up strong earnings. For regular investors, the big question is always whether these kinds of earnings pops fit their long‑term plan, not just the next few days of price action.

Moves like this are a good reminder to look at position size, diversification, and what account you’re holding it in (taxable vs IRA, etc.), instead of just chasing the headline move.

Google will win the AI race, mark my words.

Well, I have $46 for the rest of the month after just getting my monthly pension on the first, so I'm not investing in anything, lol..But a girl can dream and I play the market in my head..But, and I don't know if you read my comment about Kevin Warsh and why I believe Trump chose him, before my comment was deleted, but I stand with my original comment that Kevin Warsh is compromised in the Epstein files and those weren't released until after Trump's announcement choosing him..I think Trump wouldn't have chosen him if he couldn't have something over him and the attempted prosecution of Jerome Powell was a message to anyone who takes the job..You better do what Trump wants no matter how insane it is.. I'm just going to enjoy my last months of a pension benefit until my pension fund tanks with the rest of the economy..And then I shall start digging for gold in my backyard..

What do you think about next Fed Chair and the outlook for commodities? How was your week?

So what's new?

**Key points:**

\- Fed Chairman Warsh appointment: President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday. He is a known hawk; his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort, tending toward short-term interest rate drops while maintaining long-term raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric.

\- Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday, January 28, stating the U.S. is not planning to intervene, indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis.

\- The Yen reached a critical low point this week, testing the 158-159 range (closing Friday at 154.73). Any further drops become an un-ignorable domestic cost of living issue, and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160.

\- Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5% (down from 2.0%), virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate intervention, as rates remain pinned at 0.75%.

\- US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0% line (the 30-year ended Friday at 4.87%), a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse.

\- Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent; the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday, February 2, with auctions to follow.

**The crossroads?**

The carry trade needs to unwind, as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward, whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward. However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse.

**Avenues?**

A. The Fed could print USD to buy Yen, however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood, with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese.

B. The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen, however recent economic figures (1.5% CPI) rule this out as a short-term possibility, and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind.

C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency, via deploying USD cash reserves of \~$160.4 Billion (held as deposits at the Fed), or selling T-bills/notes/bonds from their $1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen.

As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now, leaving the most viable being option C.

However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages.

A T-bill (short-term), T-note and bond (long term) sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows, and send US Bond yields soaring, sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse, particular in longer term treasuries. Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets, spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance.

This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings, cry.pt.o typically first, high risk stocks, and then precious metals (as seen in Friday's sharp gold sell-off).

As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic, even for gold and silver, is seldom a good bet. Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail, as cash (USD/EUR/YEN) currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle. I suspect metals will find a floor, however commodities are not my turf so I'll let others do the deeper commentary there.

**The remaining option?**

There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover.

The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF, strengthening the Yen, triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short sellers, and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned, whilst also not crushing the carry trade.

Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed, the carry trade is not crushed and can slowly unwind, and global stock markets grind on higher.

However what happens next remains to be seen, and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls.

AAPL had been quieter than usual in 2025 as attention was focused on hyperscalers and AI companies. Apple seem to be out of the AI battle. Or that's what the market thinks.

They have been working on PCC(Private cloud computing), which has the potential to become their competitive edge in the smartphone industry. The idea is that new iPhones will have more powerful computing configuration and they will be able to process the ""lighter"" AI requests and send to the PCC only the ""heavier"" ones. It is expected that noone in APPLE would be able to see your data. And most importantly, noone in Google :D .

Now, that is a nice story, but let's look at the earnings report and what numbers seem to have higher weight.

I would say, number one is revenue growth acceleration. Their revenue growth had slowed down in recent years, but we could see re-acceleration in the previous quarter with 8% growth.

AAPL Fundamentals: [https://www.stockpicker.tech/user/dashboard/AAPL](https://www.stockpicker.tech/user/dashboard/AAPL)

  
Another important metric to monitor is if they can maintain their gross margin level considering the increased RAM prices.

Oftentimes I will hear people argue that it is very risky to buy these types of stocks and they will say it definitely is riskier than buying winners. 

Hear me out. First of all, I strictly speak about short term, let’s say the next 1 year. Also, my logic doesn’t apply to all stocks that have been heavily beaten down; not even most of them but most certainly some of them. Blue chip stocks especially. 

To make matters simple, let’s take a couple of examples. Is it fathomable that NKE would crash 50 % in the next 1 year? It currently trades for approximately $60 so that would mean it’d have to go down to $30. Absolutely unimaginable. Its market cap is not going to be less than $50 billion anytime soon, if ever. The last time NKE traded for $30 was thirteen years ago. 

What about PYPL? Can it crash 50 % in 1 year? It also trades for roughly $60, and if it hits $30 its market cap will be $25 billion. Impossible in the next 1 year. Not since IPO in 2015 did it trade near $30, and it a never actually touched the level. Now, keep in mind I’m not ruling out long term decline, strictly talking about 0-1 year movement here. 

Okay, so what’s an opposite type of stock- a winner, and why is it arguably not as safe from crashing something like 50 %? GOOGL. Because, if it crashes 50 % in the next year, it’ll just be back to where it was seven months ago. So it’s not absolutely unfathomable. 

One more winner where we’ve actually recently seen it happen? NFLX. Six months ago its stock price was almost double what it is today. Back then, people would say the same thing that they say about GOOGL today- \*no way\* could it crash 50 % short term. Well, It’s crashed 40 % in just six months. Could PYPL or NKE have done it? No. Fundamentals stood in the way. 

Finally, let’s look at a “loser became winner too fast” which also is not safe. KSS. It surged 300 % from April - November last year and has since crashed 40 %. I was along for the ride up and sold because it no longer fit the description of a ‘safe from crash stock.’ So I bought other stocks that are safe but has the potential to suddenly rally. KSS can currently easily crash another 50 %. 

Here is a random list of blue chip stocks that are absolutely safe from crashing anymore than 30 % in the next 1 year and at the same

time very well could double in price: CPB, FISV, WEN, SNAP, TGT, NKE, PYPL, LULU.","The short-term safety of heavily beaten down blue chips and their potential to rally are underrated.

In the above screenshot, the candle 1's high < candle 3's low, while candle 2's body in between them, which creates a gap. I you notice the next candles, they move up to cover the gap it created in the previous sessions and moving on.

I don't want to post more of it lol, but I hope you get the concept.

The more I look for them, the more I find them, they always snap back and close the gap. So I decided to backtest them.

I wanted to keep the setup very simple to avoid over fitting

**Entry**

1. Previous 3rd candle's low > previous 1st candle's high **AND**
2. Previous 2nd candle's low < previous 3rd candle's low **AND**
3. Previous 2nd candle's high > previous 1st candle's high (**the first 2 point defines the gap**) **AND**
4. Current open < Previous 3rd candle's low (**we must be below the gap to trade the gap**)

**Exit**

1. Close >= Previous 3rd candle's low, this is previous 3rd candle from the entry point **OR**
2. Close < Buy price - (atr 14 during entry \* 5), I made it to be 5 because it needs some room to move down and come back up.

Again the 83% winrate is holding up, with similar DD as SPY.

I realized that I've been testing only on stable tickers like ETFs and growth tickers like AAPL/NVDA etc.

   * Total Return: **–13.24%** ...[truncated]","I backtested Fair Value Gaps, here's what I found

Hey guys, so I was watching some videos about inner circle trading and smart money concepts, I found this gap patterns being shown a few videos. It is really an interesting one

https://preview.redd.it/n7olmssexifg1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b8a5e7e6e3947989350843309bbff4333fcc245

In the above screenshot, the candle 1's high < candle 3's low, while candle 2's body in between them, which creates a gap. I you notice the next candles, they move up to cover the gap it created in the previous sessions and moving on.

**few more examples -**

I don't want to post more of it lol, but I hope you get the concept.

The more I look for them, the more I find them, they always snap back and close the gap. So I decided to backtest them.

I wanted to keep the setup very simple to avoid over fitting

**Entry**

1. Previous 3rd candle's low > previous 1st candle's high **AND**
2. Previous 2nd candle's low < previous 3rd candle's low **AND**
3. Previous 2nd candle's high > previous 1st candle's high (**the first 2 point defines the gap**) **AND**
4. Current open < Previous 3rd candle's low (**we must be below the gap to trade the gap**)

**Exit**

1. Close >= Previous 3rd candle's low, this is previous 3rd candle from the entry point **OR**
2. Close < Buy price - (atr 14 during entry \* 5), I made it to be 5 because it needs some room to move down and come back up.

**Backtest settings -**

1. Backtest period - 2006 Jan -  2025 Dec

I bring you my highly concentrated portfolio built specifically for one thing and that alone, a recovery in oil, not a boom, just a recovery.

I have for a while now gotten increasingly skeptical about the sustainability of the overall US stock market and as such I've been seeking out the most out of favor sectors, looking for value far removed from the booming valuations of the US mega-caps/ hyper-scalers.

That brought me to a few different sectors, namely chemicals, real estate and energy, particularly traditional energy such as oil and gas, coal has already been on quite the run.

Of the sectors I identified as 'out-of-favor', chemicals seemed the hardest hit due to the enormous oversupply and undercutting coming out of China, for that reason I chose to pass on chemicals for now. Next up was real estate and while the sector does have certain names that could qualify as deep value or highly asymmetrical in their risk/reward profiles, the sector as a whole didn't seem to offer the deeply favorable odds I look for when I wanna go big on something, I like to utilize a number/style approach of waiting around until the right pitch comes and then swinging for the fences. That brought me to energy and at first it wasn't hard to see why people hated energy everywhere I looked, market participants were talking about a glut, particularly a glut of oil. Taking the consensus at face value you would have thought the industry was about to pay people to take their oil given the absolute worst of the pandemic lockdowns. A few dissident however seemed to have the facts on their side, they would argue that oil glut seemed to only exist on paper, it was the product of overestimated future supply and underestimated future demand. In my view the market has clearly sided on the side of the glut narrative and as such the stock prices of producers had fallen severely, this made like an opportunity for a very asymmetrical trade, if the optimists were right, the stock prices of particularly the smaller producers and those with elevated leverage, should re-rate meaningfully higher, all while offering a possible hedge against geopolitical uncertainty which has been raising since the start of the second Trump administration.

The Trade is still early but a meaningful rebound in crude oil and natural gas prices, although the former has more to do with weather, alongside a shift in the sentimental around investment in the industry, signals to me a shift away from the glut narrative being in the driver seat and the narrative around historic low market allocation into energy stocks and this asymmetric risk/reward, taking over.

My portfolio is mainly focused on the small/mid-cap E&P names as this is where I see the most asymmetric setups and this bucket I have companies across a spectrum of low to high(er) leverage profiles. Following the E&P names I have O&G names, here my basket is extremely concentrated on one theme, offshore, as this is by far the most asymmetrical O&G niche, they're the purest in terms of boom and bust and I'm obviously betting big on a boom. Previously I held some onshore names related to broad OFS and some more specialized names related to Valves, pipes and cracking but I traded those in for more E&P exposure, leaving only the offshore names in my OFS basket. Next up is the infrastructure names, here I only hold two names, FAI Infrastructure and New Fortress Energy, both are extremely leveraged with FAI Infrastructure needing to refinance leverage and NFE struggling to find accretive restructuring after failing to make interest payments on its debt. The midstream basket is by far my highest risk basket and this I've kept its overall allocation small. Lastly I have an allocation towards shipping, this is made up mostly by tanker stocks but also a small bet on dry bulk. The shipping basket is a bet on continued elevated geopolitical uncertainty, call it my war risk insurance, the two shipping segments also both have favorable supply dynamics that could support prices, particularly if world governments get serious about enforcement against the shadow fleet of nations such as Russia and Iran, recent enforcement from both the US and EU are supportive of this narrative.

I just wanted to share my thesis for 2026 and have your opinions whether i might be wrong or right before putting my money on the table (i probably will still do it anyways :) )

TLDR; I am short Q1-Q2 on US stocks and bitcoin, and will look for a recovery in Q3-Q4 going long.

Thesis:

1. Global liquidity started to dry up around September 2025, bitcoin topped on October 2025 (The most riskiest asset that reacts very quickly to global liquidity cycles). Currently the bitcoin price action looks incredibly similar to 2022 (the first drawdown already happened and btc price is hovering around 90k). Meanwhile the stock market is still at ATH and did not yet price in the global liquidity top (Stock markets lags bitcoin in liquidity cycles). The divergence between btc and stock market is not possible unless black swan events in bitcoin, which did not occur.
2. What will cause the bigger drawdown in the global liquidity is Japan. Japanese Yen is bleeding and with the latest intervention at the limit of 160 USD/JPY, shows that Japan won't give up that limit and the Yen will increase in value, going forward they will increase rates to strengten Yen and decrease global liquidity. As yen is crucial for the american equities (carry trade ongoing for decades), this will cause the drawdown in the us stock market to a near bear market.

The political side of this is that Japanese Prime Minister will held snap elections. Snap elections are generally held because there is no time and there will be a switch in economic policy that is considered unpopular for general public after the elections (Rate hikes that is). The most popular example of this might be the Turkish election cycles where interest rates are kept low offering cheap credit to public before elections and after elections interest rates are increased dramatically.

3) The reason Trump wants the FED to lower rates to aggressively is to offset this global liquidity crisis in their own central bank, however the FED will not lower interest rates until end of Q2, essentially lagging in the price of equities. After FED's injection of liquidity in the system, btc and equities will start to rise again.

A clean push back above 90.00 with volume reopens trend continuation, while a close under 85.80 suggests more time is needed to reset momentum.
2. NYSE: USB – $54.40. Banks remain sensitive to rate expectations, and USB is pressing into prior resistance. Holding above 53.80 keeps the breakout attempt intact, with 56.20 as the range high target. Lose 53.00 and the move likely stalls into consolidation.
3. NYSE: JNJ – $218.66. Trading just below the top of its yearly range. A decisive close over 219.75 signals acceptance higher; rejection here favors a pullback toward 212. Risk is a failure to hold that level on any weakness.",13,0.89,2,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1qhd4tf/top_3_megacaps_where_levels_matter_more_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1qhd4tf/top_3_megacaps_where_levels_matter_more_than/,neutral,"Objective analysis, no positive or negative bias."

Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I ""staggered"" the investment period by starting and ending it on ""Inauguration Day"" rather than ""New Year's Day"". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the ""staggered years"". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio ""invests"" at the close of the starting day for each period.)

# US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation

We have data for US equities, ""cash"" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting.

|CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\+10.28%|\+10.23%|\+3.33%|\+2.95%|
|Republican|47.68|\+6.58%|\+6.33%|\+4.34%|\+2.22%|
|Democratic|51.88|\+13.80%|\+13.95%|\+2.42%|\+3.63%|
|Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\+11.49%|\+11.47%|\+3.68%|\+3.71%|
|Republican|41.00|\+9.07%|\+8.96%|\+4.69%|\+3.43%|
|Democratic|45.00|\+13.74%|\+13.81%|\+2.77%|\+3.97%|

Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%).

We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%).

Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills.

# US Equities vs. Treasuries

Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills.

|CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\+10.52%|\+10.58%|\+4.52%|\+6.01%|\+3.77%|
|Republican|33.00|\+7.54%|\+7.39%|\+5.27%|\+8.94%|\+3.92%|
|Democratic|31.05|\+13.78%|\+14.06%|\+3.72%|\+2.98%|\+3.60%|

During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%).

Fixed income trading revenue rose 7% to $5.4 billion, about $110 million more than expected, according to StreetAccount.

I’m considering investing in the Chinese market because I’m convinced that Chinese tech could rise in power to the point where, in a few years, it could compete with U.S. tech in areas such as data centers, AI, or even military technology.

However, I have serious doubts about the possible scenario. While China has managed to export consumer tech products, it has often been held back as soon as it starts to threaten U.S. interests. Huawei is a good example: when it began crushing the competition, including Apple and Samsung, it was quickly stopped. Today, Huawei is little more than a Chinese company with limited international exposure, forced to use outdated processors and an operating system that is unusable outside China, making its products uncompetitive. Even when it tried to diversify to survive, Huawei failed with 5G antennas, as Europeans excluded it from the market just like the Americans did. Today, Huawei has essentially become an instrument of the Chinese state, leading the charge in the technological revolution. Some say they are developing a lithography prototype similar to ASML’s technology, thanks to heavy state investment and the poaching of ASML executives.

However, even if they succeed, what will that lead to? The U.S. and their European allies will ban imports for reasons of national security. Then, for political reasons, some countries will want to limit their imports as well.

I’m not a direct shareholder in Google, although I own some index funds that obviously are significantly exposed. In this research article I set out to understand the data points indicating Google’s change in business model and how that might affect them as an investment.

I begin by building a narrative around the future of Google’s business model, then I build a valuation model with Python to calculate the impact of the change on fair value. Reach out to me for access to the github repo.

# Executive Summary

Google faces a “Meteor Strike” event in its core Search business due to a 68% drop in Paid Click-Through-Rates (CTR) in searches with AI Overviews. While Cloud (GCP) margins are expanding, they cannot mathematically offset the deflationary pressure on Search ad inventory.

The Valuation Bridge (Bear to Bull)

I bridge the gap from the Base Case (\~$309 slightly lower than current share price) to our Fair Value estimate ($230 for a bear like me), isolating the specific impact of the “Zero-Click” shift.

**Key Drivers:**

1. **Search Volume:** Modelled as a 5% decline as users shift to “Answer Engines” (ChatGPT/Perplexity). Google says their Search Volumes are up…. but it’s a trick.
2. **Ad Pricing (The “Amazon Vacuum”):** As major advertisers like Amazon pull spend, auction pressure collapses, driving CPC down despite lower inventory.
3. **Loss of Monopoly Power:** The business and regulatory pressure risk Google’s dominant monopoly position decreases value by \~$29 per share.

# Google Search Revenue (55% of revenue)

The most important thing to understand is the impact to Google Search. It makes up 55% of revenue for the group and is the engine behind their profit.

To analyse the impact of AI on their business model I’ll use the following model to understand the value of search ads to Google’s customers; Conversion rate per dollar = Click-Through-Rate x Conversion Rate / Cost Per Click

The introduction of AI overviews has reportedly reduced Click-Through-Rate by 68% (\*). I.e, specifically on searches with AI overviews, users are clicking paid ads 68% less. That’s not a blip, it’s a meteor striking the heart of the business model. The reduction in inventory (i.e opportunities to auction ads) has caused an increase (for now at least) in the Cost per Click as fixed budgets are set - therefore there is less inventory to bid on for advertisers, so they bid more per click.

This is the “Zero-Click” phenomenon: as searchers don’t need to click anything to get the information they were looking for - it’s just served straight to their eyeballs.

However, the redeeming factor for Google is that the conversion rate has been 4-5 times higher. The narrative around this is that since people are exploring options using AI, by the time they click they are better qualified leads and convert to sales at much higher rates. All in all, the effect on advertisers has been positive.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vdwp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07166254-d503-45e2-9242-14d0c3677082_341x65.png)

Is this sustainable?

I don’t believe that these dynamics are stable, nor sustainable. The increase in Cost-per-Click is surely because advertisers have fixed budgets and haven’t yet worked out how to adjust to the new internet usage patterns. The canary in the coalmine is Amazon pulling their entire “Google shopping” ads budget abruptly in July 2025. This meant that Amazon’s share of those ads went from 60% to 0% immediately deflating the auction price for certain ad segments. It’s hard to imagine that there is any advertising company that has better data than Amazon, and this proves that advertisers like Amazon are sensitive to ad prices.

To me this is a massive red flag that the business model is broken. Firstly because Google has a monopoly on Search, but the ChatGPT style AI models are effectively a commodity and people have choice over which one they use. They have relied on their monopoly position and defended it aggressively, and now that entire dynamic is up for grabs.

Even if Google finds a way to make the Conversion Rate pay off for advertisers, this is such a fundamental shift in the way that people find information on the internet that I think this does not bode well for the existing business model.

AI Max (“Gemini-powered machine learning to simultaneously optimize keyword matching, ad creative generation, and real-time bidding to maximize conversions”) is another red flag for me - it smells like Google trying to make the advertising auction process less transparent so that they can get away with extractin ...[truncated]","Modelling the Google Death Spiral: A Monte Carlo Analysis of the 'Zero-Click' Web

It’s a commerce operating system and that changes how it should be valued.,"I keep seeing Shopify discussed in news and by investors as a leveraged bet on consumer spending or small business health. IMO, that framing misses what the company actually is.

Disclosure: I run a Shopify-focused software development and app agency, so I see the platform from the merchant and implementation side every day. That obviously gives me some bias, but it also gives me direct exposure to how Shopify actually behaves at scale, where it breaks, and where it’s genuinely strong. Also I’m not a financial professional. This is not financial advice. I’m sharing a product and systems-level perspective, not telling anyone what to buy or sell.

Shopify is not a retailer. It doesn’t own inventory, demand, or customer relationships. What it sells is abstraction.

For merchants, Shopify replaces a messy stack of infrastructure:
payments, tax logic, hosting, fraud, checkout, integrations, cross-border compliance. Most of this only becomes painful once you try to scale.

From a systems perspective, Shopify looks less like a store platform and more like an operating system for commerce.

A few points that often get misunderstood:

1. Merchant churn at the low end is expected
Shopify targets a fragmented, long-tail market. Many merchants fail. That’s not a weakness. The platform monetizes experimentation at scale. One merchant failing doesn’t matter. Millions trying does.

2. Payments matter more than subscriptions
Subscriptions get attention, but payments drive the economics. Usage-based revenue tied to GMV creates natural monetization expansion without sales teams or upsells. When merchants grow, Shopify makes more.

3. Comparing Shopify to Amazon is misleading
Amazon is centralized. It owns discovery, fulfillment, pricing, and customer data. Shopify is decentralized infrastructure. Merchants own the brand and customer relationship. Shopify stays in the background.

This difference caps near-term monetization but reduces regulatory risk and platform conflict.

4. Fulfillment was a misstep
Trying to build a first-party logistics network conflicted with Shopify’s software DNA. Exiting it was the right move in my opinion. Merchants want integration and orchestration, not Shopify owning warehouses.

5. Margins look worse than they are
Shopify isn’t pure SaaS. Payments and services delay operating leverage. Profitability shows up later, not sooner. The real question is long-term unit economics, not quarterly margins.

None of this makes Shopify “cheap” or risk-free. It’s cyclical, sensitive to GMV, and downstream from ad platforms like Meta and Google. But from a product and incentive standpoint, it’s one of the more interesting platforms in public markets.

Now the huge growth happens behind closed doors. OpenAI talking raises that could hit 800B+ valuation, zero public shares. SpaceX already at 800B private. Same with Anthropic pushing 350B, Databricks 134B, all locked up.

NVDA went public in 99 and retail could grab it dirt cheap, ride the whole way up. That doesnt happen anymore, the 100x part is private now.

So hows retail supposed to get any edge these days? Secondary platforms, small cap hunting, venture funds if youre rich enough? Or we just stuck buying winners after they already 50xd private?

However, they're still posting massive losses. They hope to reach $20 billion in revenue in 2026. But like ChatGPT, they're burning cash like crazy.

Who’s going to fund that? Microsoft and Nvidia with their new partnership? I still wonder when they're going to start charging users and with what money... Because I get the impression that today, these AI companies are empty shells where everyone throws in a coin that's used to fund infrastructure, but we don't know if those coins will be enough to cover it, and if so, whether the companies that contributed will see any return on this kind of setup.

Why you won’t find them online yet.,"I want to clear something up because a few people messaged me asking why they can’t find certain RIME revenue figures on Google or in public filings.



The ARR and contract numbers I mentioned earlier come from slides shown at a private investor event, not from a public earnings release or SEC filing. That means they are not publicly distributed yet, which is why you won’t see them on financial websites or news feeds.

They simply haven’t been released through official public channels yet.



Why does this still matter to regular investors and traders?



Because the type of information matters even before it becomes public. The slides focused on enterprise contract size, ARR trajectory, and real-world cost savings, not vague projections or TAM fluff. Whether the exact numbers hold or change slightly when they eventually go public, the direction is what’s important. This is not a concept stage story anymore



Also, the current stock price and valuation are based almost entirely on public legacy data, not on what was presented privately. That helps explain why the valuation still looks disconnected from what the business is becoming. Markets only price what they can clearly see.



None of this is a guarantee of anything. Until numbers are formally disclosed, they should be treated as context, not gospel. Everyone should do their own work and size risk accordingly. I’m sharing this so people understand why the data isn’t searchable yet, not to hype something that hasn’t been officially reported.



If and when these figures show up in public filings or earnings calls, that’s when the market will decide what they’re worth. Until then, this is simply information about how the company is positioning itself to existing investors.



Use it however you want. Ignore it if it doesn’t fit your risk tolerance. Just wanted to be upfront so nobody wastes time looking for PDFs that don’t exist yet.","Quick note on the RIME revenue numbers floating around. Why you won’t find them online yet.

It’s always a Wednesday, at market open everything is red, and then just after lunch usually around 1:30 PM, the fed announces a rate cut, and then there’s a big market reversal Usually up into market close.

The way I see it, Wall Street is always red in the morning as a hedge, just in case there is more hawkish tone than anticipated in what Jerome Powell says at the meeting.

Obviously, there are a lot of assumptions in what I just said. I’m sure many people would disagree and say that the rate cut is already baked in to the price action, and that may be true, but my prediction is that the above will occur.

If you operate under some of the assumptions I’ve made, what would you anticipate rises the most as a result of a 25 basis point rate cut later today?

Personally, I don’t think that a rate cut is already priced in, because it was only a couple of weeks ago that damn near everyone was expecting there to be no cut at all. When the government had shut down and finally reopened in late October, all the prediction markets and Wall Street analysts were expecting rates to stay the same going into 2026. 

Moreover, the month of November was very uncharacteristic in how red it is, and I think all of these concerns of an AI bubble are just unfounded and overly fearful. There are many tailwinds going into the end of the year. We are due for a Santa rally over the last three weeks of December. 

Furthermore, Nvidia, which smashed earnings, and just unlocked sales in China, should be trading at around $200 but instead is stuck at around 185 despite copious pieces of good news.

I think people are overly worried about Google‘s TPUs and my hope is that this rate cut acts as a catalyst for stocks for the rest of the year.",0,0.29,20,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1pj64h7/what_sorts_of_things_should_we_be_buying_right/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1pj64h7/what_sorts_of_things_should_we_be_buying_right/,positive,Optimistic about market rally and stock gains.

1pgub7n,StockMarket,Vegetable-Bug-9779,1765143306.0,2025-12-08T05:35:06+08:00,Is Visa the most resilient business in the world?,"I've been holding VIsa(and Mastercard) since 2023. Here is my thesis. Let me know if you think I am missing something.

Visa, together with Mastercard dominate the payment industry in a duopoly and both companies have a tollbooth on global payments. My AVG breakeven price of V is $236.

In general, I believe this is the best combination of the widest possible moat complemented by secular trends tailwinds. As a result, we can see very predictable revenue growth.

[Visa Revenue Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ix90wei6pu5g1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=77651c734a26876f59bb83bd2415d1ec4026b038)

I see two very strong secular trends that the company benefits from.

1. Global Shift to Digital Payments: there are many parts of the world where people still use mainly cash and slowly but surely they move more to card and online payments. The clear beneficiaries from that are Mastercard and Visa.
2. Inflation and monetary policy - The central banks worldwide target 2% inflation and they are pushing towards their goal with monetary measures like interest rates and quantitative easing. This leads to general worldwide price increase for all products, thus Visa and Mastercard increase revenue without increasing operating costs. This operating leverage leads to margin expansion.

Their network effects are so strong that they can easily adapt to any new technology and competition. They have adapted to every potential disruption that have occurred in the last years.

And even if some of those payments are cheaper and reduce their margins, it is insignificant compared to the big picture. After all, the only ones who are complaining about their tollbooth fees are banks and merchants. Consumers like credit cards as they provide loyalty points and security.

Their competitive advantage gives them immense pricing power and the only threat I see to it is government scrutiny.

There are some other important points:

Visa is a capital light business. Unlike American Express, for example, they work in an open-loop model where they do not lend money to customers, which makes them more resilient . This is why American Express(another great company, I hold them too) has bank-like valuation while MA and V are trading at tech-like multiples.

So far the analysis was directed for both Visa and Mastercard. I will continue only with Visa. If you want to know more about Mastercard, I recently posted why I bought the stock in [r/stockpickeranalysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockpickeranalysis/) .

Visa is the biggest player in payments, much bigger than Mastercard. I recently read that the duopoly holds roughly 90% of the payment processing outside China and those 90% are plit 60% for V and 30% for MA.

The have the dominant position and they are leveraging it well.

They are aggressively targeting B2B, business to consumer and government to consumer payments, mainly through their platforms Visa Direct and Visa B2B connect.

We are talking about $200T of payments here so the TAM is huge.

Also, similar to Mastercard, their Value Added Services segment is growing significantly(25% year over year), making the company a diversified SaaS provider. They are selling valuable analytics from their payment network to Banks, businesses and government. You would agree with me that data for customer spending is probably the most valuable insights you can spend for.

In addition:

They are actively buying back shares

Operating margin is 65%

Return on Capital Employed is growing significantly

Their net debt is insignificant to the cashflows they generate

Their forward PE ratio is 24x

In general, both companies have extremely wide moat and predictability. Boring companies that have been doing well for decades. I believe they will continue and this is why I am holding them.

It still appears robust at present, though I sense a potential minor pullback in the near term. Technically speaking, support sits near $316, resistance lies between $324-$326, and all moving averages are trending upward making the current chart pattern quite bullish.

For a major tech company, Google's valuation isn't unreasonable: its P/E ratio hovers around 30-31 times, and its PEG ratio sits at roughly 1.7. Compared to peers, this valuation seems fairly justified. Third quarter earnings were solid, and growth in AI/cloud computing remains robust. Most analysts still recommend “Buy,” though their target prices are now very close to Google's current share price.

Well, here is my view/experience of Google/Gemini recently (over the last week):

* I asked Gemini to put on a map a trip I did abroad recently. Couldn't even put properly on a map the various locations I gave (which are not obscure). Generated a text version first, then found on the web a possible version of a map. I pushed it to generate a picture and it managed to put the same location at different places. Useless
* I asked Gemini to create a travel itinerary, which it did in a table. I then asked to create a Google Keep version of it. Couldn't do it, since Google Keep doesn't support tables, only basic text. Didn't manage to convert the content displayed in Gemini in a suitable version for Google Keep
* I asked Gemini to comment on the performance of an ETF vs another. It quoted my own post on Reddit, which is not really trustworthy information. When I asked the performance over last week, quoted data from September. Surely, fetching performance data of mainstream ETFs is not rocket science, plenty of sources. It could also easily fetch the price a week ago and now, and just compare
* I keep seeing adverts on YouTube on products and service I already have. Yes, there is a reason why I go to those websites... Not sure why those companies are paying ads that are displayed to their existing customers. Complete waste of money. Advertising is basically Google's core business, so this is quite worrying
* Bought recently some Google Pixel Buds 2a. They don't seem to work well at all with Gemini. Google Assistance is better. Gemini can't start some music etc.

My conclusion: all pretty dumb currently. No, AI is not going to replace most jobs any time soon. It will surely be transformative in the long run, but the massive investments being made now (specifically hardware) will have no ROI before the hardware is obsolete","Is there an AI bubble?

* Google was able to scale its AI quickly, and Gemini now has 650 million monthly active users, a stone's throw away from OpenAI’s 800 million.
* Fears that AI is cannibalizing traditional search seem misplaced with search revenue growing 15% YoY as reported on Alphabet’s latest quarter.
* The market is now realizing that Alphabet is the only company that has hardware, a foundation model, and distribution.

Google [released](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/) its latest model, Gemini 3, and it absolutely blew the competition away in benchmark testing.

The kicker? Google used its own processors *(TPUs)* and not Nvidia chips to train the Gemini 3 model. This means Google has just leapfrogged OpenAI in the competition, and the structural advantages are now becoming evident.

* Google has 4 billion users across Search, YouTube, and Gmail who generate valuable training data for their models. Compared to this, all the data OpenAI uses must either be scraped from the web *(which raises copyright issues)* or acquired from other companies *(which worsens their margins)*.



* The TPUs that Google used for training their latest model are designed by Google itself and integrated directly into Google’s data centers. While there are rumors that TPUs are better for machine learning workloads as they are custom-designed *(vis-a-vis GPUs)*, the critical point is that Google can avoid Nvidia's premium *(Nvidia has a 75% margin on its chips)* that OpenAI has to pay.



* Finally, Gemini is gaining market share rapidly. Now that they have the best model and lower generation costs, they can instantly distribute it to their 4 billion-user base, thereby undercutting OpenAI’s first-mover advantage. Most users don’t care which AI they use as long as it gets the job done.

This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from November 14 to November 21.

This week, our agenda had 3 main topics: Nvidia's results, Fed rate cut expectations, and tariffs. Tariff pressures decreased compare to recent weeks, but it's still on the table.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

October 24 close at 6,791.69 - October 31 close at 6,840.20 🟢 (+0.71%)

October 31 close at 6,840.20 - November 7 close at 6,728.81 🔴 (-1.63%)

November 7 close at 6,728.81 - November 14 close at 6,734.11 🟢 (+0.08%)

November 14 close at 6,734.11 - November 21 close at 6,602.96 🔴 (-1.95%)

🔸 Monday: After the last two negative days of the previous week, the stock market opened in same path and lower. The economical datas had started from this week. The main focus is Nvidia's result that came after the session of Wednesday's. The flight operations returned to normal. Warren Buffett released his portfolio and revealed $4.9B Google stake, and Google gained more than 3% at the close. It was a bad day. The stock market closed lower more than 1%. The Nasdaq led. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: The government was closed for 43 days and a lot of data could not be released. Before the session, Jobless Claims for the week ended October 18 were released on the government website at 232K. Meanwhile, Trump said we want 1% inflation. The stock market opened lower again. Fed's Barkin said he agrees with Powell that a December interest rate cut is not a foregone conclusion. Trump also said he has chosen next Fed chair. The stock market closed lower and extended losing streak to 4-day. Gold drooped and jumped $4,000 again. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: The big day of the week arrived. Nvidia's result had released after the session. Bessent said Trump to decide on the next Federal Reserve Chair before Christmas. The stock market opened higher after 4-day losing streak. During the session, Fed minutes were released and shows that several participants were against rate cut. The stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Nvidia released results and Q4 revenue outlook topped estimates. The stock gained more than 5% in the futures market. U.S. continuing jobless claims rise to 1.974M and it's highest since November 2021. The stock market opened higher more than 1%, but it could not hold gains and closed lower more than 1.5% in final hour. The S&P 500 closed at the support around 6,500. It's lowest level since October 14. Nvidia closed lower more than 3%. It has high volatility from 5% to -3%. Gold held steady, but silver crashed. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Trump removed 40% tariff on Brazilian beef and coffee. Fed's Williams said that we don't have insights on whether market overvalued. He also said support for rate cut. The stock market opened higher after Thursday's heavy selling. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations came at 4.5%. It was 4.7% in previous month. The stock market closed higher on renewed rate cut hopes. The S&P 500 gained 1%. 🟢

Nvidia's result was strong. The investors preferred to bull side in futures market, but during the session, it turned to opposite. Rate cut expectations remains uncertain. During the week, The possibility of 25 point rate cut fell below 50% on The CME FedWatch tool, but now it's up to 71%. It was tough week. The S&P 500 dropped 1.95% and it's biggest lost since the week of October 5. It seems that volatility will continue until the Fed rate cut decision. Overall, I'm still optimistic side especially Nasdaq.

>The comments offer a rare glimpse into how the face of the AI boom views the growing backlash to it, and how closely he is watching the market’s whiplash response.
>A blowout quarter that spooked investors
>
>On paper, Nvidia gave investors about everything they had asked for. The chipmaker reported another surge in sales of its data-center processors, the workhorses that power large AI models (and Nvidia’s revenues), and raised its guidance for the current quarter. It was the kind of performance expected to kick off another six-month rally, investors were saying. 
>
>Instead, the stock’s initial jump gave way to a broad selloff. Nvidia climbed as much as 5% early in Thursday’s session before closing down roughly 3%, as traders rotated out of the Big Tech names most closely associated with the AI boom. 
>
>The reversal extended what has become a bruising stretch for the so-called AI trade. After months of a breathless rally, investors are increasingly anxious that tech giants are spending too aggressively on data centers, GPUs, and networking gear, with no guarantee they can earn enough revenue to get those investments back. Some are also focusing on the complex, debt-heavy financing structures behind the AI infrastructure build-out, with credit markets starting to flash early warning signs.
>
>Layered on top of that are fresh macro jitters. A shutdown-delayed U.S. jobs report, released the same morning, showed stronger-than-expected hiring in September, but a higher unemployment rate; this conflicting data did little to clarify whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December.
>
>Some investors are closely watching different statements from Fed presidents to try to read the tea leaves, but with the earnings season winding down and no obvious catalyst between now and the Fed’s next decision, it appears that many other investors are using the volatility to lock in profits from the year’s earlier rally—and get out of the market.
>
>“The broader narrative hasn’t broken; it’s simply being tested right now,” Mark Hackett at Nationwide told Bloomberg. “Periods like this often act as a release valve rather than signaling a true trend reversal. 
>‘We’re basically holding the planet together‘
>
>Inside Nvidia, Huang suggested no one should be surprised that investors are jumpy when so much of the AI story is being projected onto a single company.
>
>He referenced online memes that jokingly describe Nvidia as the linchpin of the global economy and **the only thing standing between the U.S. and recession**.
>
>“Have you guys seen some of them?” he asked employees. “We’re basically holding the planet together—and it’s not untrue.”
>
>That level of mythos has helped propel Nvidia’s market value into the stratosphere, making it the world’s most valuable public company. But Huang made clear that it has also turned every earnings day into a high-wire act.
>
>“The expectations are so high that if we miss by just a little bit, people think the whole story is broken,” he said.
>
>Still, Huang pushed back on the idea that Nvidia is responsible for the frothier parts of the AI trade. The company’s job, he emphasized, is to build the compute infrastructure others need, not to police how the market prices demand.

>
>On paper, Nvidia gave investors about everything they had asked for. The chipmaker reported another surge in sales of its data-center processors, the workhorses that power large AI models (and Nvidia’s revenues), and raised its guidance for the current quarter. It was the kind of performance expected to kick off another six-month rally, investors were saying. 
>
>Instead, the stock’s initial jump gave way to a broad selloff. Nvidia climbed as much as 5% early in Thursday’s session before closing down roughly 3%, as traders rotated out of the Big Tech names most closely associated with the AI boom. 
>
>The reversal extended what has become a bruising stretch for the so-called AI trade. After months of a breathless rally, investors are increasingly anxious that tech giants are spending too aggressively on data centers, GPUs, and networking gear, with no guarantee they can earn enough revenue to get those investments back. Some are also focusing on the complex, debt-heavy financing structures behind the AI infrastructure build-out, with credit markets starting to flash early warning signs.
>
>Layered on top of that are fresh macro jitters. A shutdown-delayed U.S. jobs report, released the same morning, showed stronger-than-expected hiring in September, but a higher unemployment rate; this conflicting data did little to clarify whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December.
>
>Some investors are closely watching different statements from Fed presidents to try to read the tea leaves, but with the earnings season winding down and no obvious catalyst between now and the Fed’s next decision, it appears that many other investors are using the volatility to lock in profits from the year’s earlier rally—and get out of the market.

>‘We’re basically holding the planet together‘
>
>Inside Nvidia, Huang suggested no one should be surprised that investors are jumpy when so much of the AI story is being projected onto a single company.

>He referenced online memes that jokingly describe Nvidia as the linchpin of the global economy and **the only thing standing between the U.S. and recession**.
>
>“Have you guys seen some of them?” he asked employees. “We’re basically holding the planet together—and it’s not untrue.”
>
>That level of mythos has helped propel Nvidia’s market value into the stratosphere, making it the world’s most valuable public company. But Huang made clear that it has also turned every earnings day into a high-wire act.
>
>“The expectations are so high that if we miss by just a little bit, people think the whole story is broken,” he said.
>
>Still, Huang pushed back on the idea that Nvidia is responsible for the frothier parts of the AI trade. The company’s job, he emphasized, is to build the compute infrastructure others need, not to police how the market prices demand.

“MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud,” the Euro Pacific Asset Management global strategist said Sunday on X, challenging Strategy Chair Michael Saylor to a debate at the cryptocurrency conference Binance Blockchain Week scheduled for early December in Dubai.

“Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt,” Schiff added.

Schiff, in a separate X post, said Strategy would not pay the dividends on the preferred shares it has increasingly come to depend on to raise capital to acquire Bitcoin. 

“Once fund managers realize this they’ll dump the preferreds & $MSTR won’t be able to issue any more, setting off a death spiral,” he said.

Strategy over the past five years has built a business around issuing equity to accumulate Bitcoin. The idea? Maximizing Bitcoin per share for shareholders and acting as a proxy for investors who ordinarily can not gain exposure to the digital asset.

Schiff’s remarks come as Strategy has increasingly turned to preferreds rather than common stock for capital raises in recent months. The shift comes as the company’s premium to net asset value has contracted significantly, making it difficult to issue equity to fund new Bitcoin purchases without diluting shareholders. The metric has fallen from over 2.5 to less than 1 in the past year.

The contraction has coincided with an explosion of copycat companies in recent months. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, there are now 194 companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. 

Beyond the rise of copycats, Strategy has faced additional pressure from Bitcoin’s market slide in the past month, from a price record of $126,000 to as low as $89,000 on Tuesday.

While preferred stocks enable Strategy to continue accumulating Bitcoin in the face of such headwinds, the company lacks significant cash flow, which means dividends to old investors would be paid from capital raised from new investors, which raises red flags for some. 

The company had nearly $700 million in annual dividend obligations as of Q3.

“We wouldn’t miss a single dividend payment on an 80% drawdown,” Saylor said in Strategy’s Q2 earnings call at the end of July.","Strategy's 'Entire Business Model Is A Fraud': Gold Bug Peter Schiff Challenges Michael Saylor To A Debate - Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)

Forward P/E sits around 28 to 29 times.  
Street estimates call for FY 2026 EPS of about $4.55 and FY 2027 EPS near $6.76, equating to approximately 49 percent annual growth.  
Nvidia is guiding to roughly 54 percent revenue growth for the upcoming quarter with revenue estimates of 54 billion dollars.

**NVDA customers and their financial capacity**  
Many of Nvidia’s largest hardware customers rely on debt financed data centers or external financing structures. Their ability to continue purchasing at scale depends on interest costs, refinancing, and lender demand.

**CoreWeave**  
Q3 2025 revenue was 1.365 billion dollars, up from 584 million dollars.  
GAAP operating income was 51.9 million dollars or a 4 percent margin, down from 20 percent a year earlier.  
Interest expense was about 310.6 million dollars, more than six times operating income.  
Net loss: 110 million dollars.  
Total debt stands near 10.6 billion dollars with net debt around 9.3 billion dollars.  
Senior notes yield 9 to 9.25 percent.  
A 7.5 to 7.6 billion dollar GPU backed loan required covenant waivers.  
Leverage is estimated near 7 times EBITDA.  
CoreWeave purchases significant volumes of Nvidia hardware. Future purchase sustainability depends on refinancing capacity in addition to demand.

**xAI**  
Raising up to 12.5 billion dollars in debt and about 7.5 billion dollars in equity.  
Structured through an SPV that acquires Nvidia GPUs and leases them to xAI under multi year terms.  
Debt maturities cluster within a three to five year window.

**Meta Hyperion financing**  
A 27 to 29 billion dollar structure.  
Includes A rated bonds yielding about 6.6 percent and 3 billion dollars in equity from Blue Owl.

**AI data center project loans**  
Blackstone, KKR, Brookfield, DigitalBridge and others have arranged tens of billions in project level financing for AI focused data centers.

**AI cloud platforms such as Lambda Labs and Crusoe**  
Use venture debt, equipment leases, and asset backed facilities to scale GPU deployments.

Across these customers groups, approximately 50 to 70 billion dollars in debt is tied directly or indirectly to acquiring Nvidia hardware or building the infrastructure required to run it.

**Hyperscalers and broader AI capex**  
Microsoft is on pace for more than 80 billion dollars in AI enabled data center spending for fiscal 2025, with quarterly capex near 25 to 35 billion dollars and rising.  
Amazon raised its 2025 capex outlook to 125 billion dollars, with more than 100 billion dollars tied to cloud and AI.  
Alphabet increased its 2025 capex guidance to 91 to 93 billion dollars.  
Meta expects 70 to 72 billion dollars this year and has signaled higher spending in 2026.  
Oracle plans roughly 25 billion dollars to expand cloud and AI infrastructure.  
Together, these firms are on track for more than 150 billion dollars in AI related spending this year, and 370 to 400 billion dollars across future cycles.

**Implications for NVDA share price trajectory**  
A forward P/E near 28 assumes that hyperscalers and specialized cloud providers maintain or increase their rate of spending for several years.  
CoreWeave’s results show rising interest costs and contracting margins.  
Other leveraged buyers may face similar financing constraints.  
Hyperscalers continue to invest, but at capital costs well above levels from earlier in the cycle.  
If credit conditions tighten or refinancing slows, the growth rate implied in Nvidia’s valuation becomes more difficult to sustain.","Nvidia’s Earnings and Share Price Trajectory

**NVDA valuation**  
Forward P/E sits around 28 to 29 times.  
Street estimates call for FY 2026 EPS of about $4.55 and FY 2027 EPS near $6.76, equating to approximately 49 percent annual growth.  
Nvidia is guiding to roughly 54 percent revenue growth for the upcoming quarter with revenue estimates of 54 billion dollars.

**NVDA customers and their financial capacity**  
Many of Nvidia’s largest hardware customers rely on debt financed data centers or external financing structures. Their ability to continue purchasing at scale depends on interest costs, refinancing, and lender demand.

**CoreWeave**  
Q3 2025 revenue was 1.365 billion dollars, up from 584 million dollars.  
GAAP operating income was 51.9 million dollars or a 4 percent margin, down from 20 percent a year earlier.  
Interest expense was about 310.6 million dollars, more than six times operating income.  
Net loss: 110 million dollars.  
Total debt stands near 10.6 billion dollars with net debt around 9.3 billion dollars.  
Senior notes yield 9 to 9.25 percent.  
A 7.5 to 7.6 billion dollar GPU backed loan required covenant waivers.  
Leverage is estimated near 7 times EBITDA.  
CoreWeave purchases significant volumes of Nvidia hardware. Future purchase sustainability depends on refinancing capacity in addition to demand.

**xAI**  
Raising up to 12.5 billion dollars in debt and about 7.5 billion dollars in equity.  
Structured through an SPV that acquires Nvidia GPUs and leases them to xAI under multi year terms.  
Debt maturities cluster within a three to five year window.

**Meta Hyperion financing**  
A 27 to 29 billion dollar structure.  
Includes A rated bonds yielding about 6.6 percent and 3 billion dollars in equity from Blue Owl.

Trump Media $DJT recently reported quarterly earnings and they were pretty miserable all around. Still, the one positive thing that stands out is it’s $3.1B in financial assets. A large chunk of those assets is made up of digital assets in the shape of mostly bitcoin. So, the company owns 11,500 bitcoin valued at approximately $1.1 billion. 

The market cap right now is $3.1B which perfectly equals its financial assets. The company has more than just a digital assets treasury going for it- most notably the social media platform Truth Social.

My question that I would like to hear people’s opinion on is at what point does reality catch up with this stock?

For the stock to touch anything near all time highs there has to be a meme related surge. 

What do you all think?

Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary data came at 4.7% that slightly higher than last month's 4.6%. Trump said wasn't worried about AI bubble. He also said inflation is 'at a perfect number'. These two topics gave a hope and the S&P 500 recovered more than 1% point. The stock market closed higher. 🟢

Michael Burry caused unease and the stock market already ready for it. After the 3-week winning streak, The S&P 500 closed lower more than 1.5%. We know the market doesn't move in a straight line, but the overall direction seems likely to remain upward. What do you think about the AI bubble? Some companies valuations are extremely high. Could Michael Burry be proven right?

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

Between 2009 (post-2008 correction) and 2025, the annual growth has been 15% a year, so less per year but over a much longer period (16 years).

The 2008 financial crisis was a drop of 50% of the S&P500.

Losing gains of the last 4 years would mean a 15% drop for the S&P500.

Average recovery time of the last 4 market crashes was almost 4 years.

If the top 10 largest US valuations (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple etc.) dropped by 25%, a global index tracker would drop by 5%, the S&P500 would drop by 8%.

Of course, if the top 10 largest US valuation dropped by 50%, you would also expect many other companies to drop significantly due to negative sentiment.

My conclusions:

* Don't just invest in the S&P500 if you fear the top 10 US valuations are very inflated (AI bubble). A global index tracker would soften the blow a bit

This is why you can’t predict the markets.,"I made predictions for all the stocks in my portfolio. In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. 

My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025**

 

**GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock

**NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs.

The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up.

Even though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView.

However, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24.

This is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025

**NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). 

However, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors.

Q3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well.

Even though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.**

Despite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings. This is why I will **buy** some NFLX before earnings tomorrow.

**MU:** Earnings were fantastic. **Revenue surged up to 37.8B, nearly a 49% increase year-over-year.** Analyst targets range from $240 to $270, which is approximately a 20 – 30% upside.

Although a fantastic earnings report, MU plans to **sever its chip business in China** after its ban in 2023 on its products in infrastructure. While it will still supply some things to China, this will likely, over **the long term hurt, revenue and revenue diversification**. MU has also been facing tariff headwinds **after the U.S added 10% universal tariffs** on all imports, which MU has suffered from.

This is why I will **hold** until geopolitical tensions decrease. **If they increase, I will sell a chunk of my position**. I have already made 33% profit at the time of writing.

**UNH:** One of the biggest healthcare / insurance service companies in the U.S, with exposure across insurance (UnitedHealthcare), health services, data and pharmacy benefits. This means it has multiple levers for revenue and margin improvement. It is an established network, relationships with other companies have been built over many decades (since 1977)

**Investors like Warren Buffett and Michael Burry** have invested billions into UNH, seeing it as undervalued from recent highs. However, there is a reason for UNH being valued as ‘undervalued’.

UNH have been facing rising medical costs, utilization and squeezed margins. The company has faced **a lot of uncertainty**, even at one point **suspending its 1-year outlook**. The company has faced **ongoing scrutiny into the investigation of Medicare billing practices and over adjustments**.

This could bring **potential fines, reputational damages or operational constraints**. **The UNH CEO, who was shot in December 2024** caused turmoil in the company. Even though it’s been nine months since the shooting, it has scarred many investors, and customers about why the CEO was shot, and if UNH is doing bad practices at the company.

For these reasons, I will likely **hold** the stock for the foreseeable future.

**JNJ:** The stock has seen a good Q3 report, **sales up 6.8% year over year**. The growth came from its **“Innovative Medicine” and “MedTech”** segments, so its not overly reliant on one division. JNJ is also pushing new therapies into the markets, so its business is diverse.

JNJ also revised down its **tariff expectations from $400M to $200M**, reflecting improved global trade conditions. The reason why I b ...[truncated]","These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days. This is why you can’t predict the markets.

My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025**

 

**GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock

**NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs.

The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up.

 No asset is ever so good if it is over pricey. Briefly I gathered it is one of the cores of his theories.

And so I am not interested in gold. At least not at this moment.

 I would not argue that gold is a good hedge against inflation, currency debasement and geopolitical instability. In this regard, I fully agree with Mr. Ray Dalio’s view, another guru whose theories underpin my own. His book How Countries Go Broke is what I have been reading lately and I found the book really great.

 In my view, the best time for buying gold as an hedge is GONE. If you want to do it, probably the best time was right after COVID’s breakout, or at the latest the beginning of Ukraine war. That was what the ex-citi trader Gary Steveson had done, according to himself. Now, hovering around 4000 it is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.

 There is a huge private gold reserve round the globe. In case of rapid economic downturn, you will find private gold sold into the market. This can rapidly drag down the price of spot gold.

There are many gurus whose principles underpin my views on finance, and one of them is Mr. Howard Marks. From his books, I gathered the importance of price.

 No asset is ever so good if it is over pricey. Briefly I gathered it is one of the cores of his theories.

And so I am not interested in gold. At least not at this moment.

 I would not argue that gold is a good hedge against inflation, currency debasement and geopolitical instability. In this regard, I fully agree with Mr. Ray Dalio’s view, another guru whose theories underpin my own. His book How Countries Go Broke is what I have been reading lately and I found the book really great.

 In my view, the best time for buying gold as an hedge is GONE. If you want to do it, probably the best time was right after COVID’s breakout, or at the latest the beginning of Ukraine war. That was what the ex-citi trader Gary Steveson had done, according to himself. Now, hovering around 4000 it is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.

 There is a huge private gold reserve round the globe. In case of rapid economic downturn, you will find private gold sold into the market. This can rapidly drag down the price of spot gold.

You may remember me from four years ago, when these indicators were very accurate at identifying the period of the bottom during the 2022 end of the bear market.

*If you hate technical analysis, please stay away from this post and dont ruin this post for those of us that are interested in it or hold value to it. Thank you.*

**TLDR: Bottom is not yet in based on technical indicators (but we may be close).**

**1 and 2: 200 weekly moving average – NO**

The 200 weekly moving average is one of the most important moving average in trading. Both the Bitcoin and total market cap 200 weekly moving average have a rich history of acting as key support and every time we hit the 200 weekly moving average, we were essentially at the bottom.

Honestly, we didnt quite tap it on the total market cap and we usually do.

And not on the Bitcoin chart either, which we usually do.

**3: Pi Cycle indicator - NO**

The Pi cycle indicator is based on two long-term moving averages (the 471-day simple moving average and 150-day exponential moving average) and identifies both tops and bottoms. This indicator has an insane track record of identifying the tops and bottoms. When the red line crosses below the blue, the pi cycle bottom is marked.

**4: Hash ribbons indicator - NO**

The Bitcoin Hash Ribbon indicator identifies periods when miners of Bitcoin are capitulating, under the assumption that Bitcoin is then at a key price for buying. These buy signals have typically been made at/near bottoms, as can be seen on the chart below. Not a 100% accuracy, but most of the times this indicator is very accurate. No signal yet though miners are definitely capitulating now.

**5: Puell Multiple indicator – NO**

The Puell Multiple indicator is complicated so I will not explain it in great detail. In short, the top area reflects miners’ revenues being very high relative to history and the bottom area reflects miners’ revenues as significantly lower relative to history.

Every major bottom has dipped in the bottom zone at a 0.50 level (see left axis). We are not there yet.

**6: Weekly RSI – YES (but can go lower)**

The relative strength index (RSI) reflects the strength in the market at a moment in time. In the past bear markets, weekly RSI hit oversold levels (beneath the purple band on the picture below) on the weekly time frame at the low and then bounced. We just hit the technical oversold level. That is a great sign and usually where we bounce.

**7 and 8: Moving average crosses - NO**

Dont ask me why, but every time the 50-week moving average (orange) crossed down below the weekly 100 moving average (red), the bottom had already been in a couple of weeks before or was about to be in. I marked these key moments with a purple vertical line. This has not happened yet.

Dont ask me why, but every time the 20-week moving average (orange) crossed down the 100-week moving average (red), the bottom was about to be in. I marked these key moments with a purple vertical line. This has not happened yet either.

**9: MRV Z-score indicator - NO**

The MRV Z-score indicator is also more difficult to explain. It aims to identify where bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to a fair value indicator. At the green levels below, this indicator suggests bitcoin is very undervalued. This green zone has always been a great buying opportunity. We are almost  the green zone, so this indicator says this is a great buying area. But we have historically gone lower on this indicator so with a conservative perspective I would have to conclude that there is not enough evidence based on this indicator that the bottom is in.

You can do all the fancy chart you want! It's gonna be downhill for next 2 years. 


Will buy some BTC at 25k..order placed already. For .001 BTC going to be zillionaire in next bull.

isnt it weird to use the rainbow chart as an example of cycle theory when in it you can see this wasnt a cycle and bitcoin didnt even reach the ""sell"" part of the rainbow chart? seriosly in the first rainbow chart the ath is at ""hodl"" and on the second the ath is still at ""BUY"". I think traditional cycle theory is no longer applicable and this can just be considered a very long lateralization period isntead of a traditional cycle, we didnt actually have a bullurun

The issue here is the methodology, it feels like finding data to suit a pre-conceived narrative rather than letting the data form the conclusion. Technical analysis in a market as young as crypto suffers heavily from survivorship bias. We are essentially looking at a handful of previous data points and assuming the macro environment is identical, which it rarely is.

Telling people to ""stay away"" if they dislike TA is a great way to build an echo chamber, but a poor way to conduct financial analysis.

I didn't even realize there are people who think they're gonna get rich off BTC at this point. Image the capital that would need to move into BTC to double or triple. It's monstrous. If you're buying and hodling you're just gonna get burned. Big institutions are trading at thousands of trades per second. The game ain't the same anymore.

And USD is worth less than before.

1 BTC is 57 624 € atm. And going DOOWN

As I started to type this, it updated and it's 57 610 € now.

So for all those paying attention:

The “bitcoin president” loosened controls on funds buying crypto.  

Funds like black rock bought in and sparked a massive rally.  

They pumped the finance media spheres with headlines about bitcoin going to $1M.  

They happily sold you bags at $130k.  

Now they’re out with billions in easy liquidity.  

The dream of Bitcoin died when funds like black rock and MSTR got involved.

It's not nearly as many, but people definitely do auto buy bitcoin. That's a feature on coinbase and they also have a bitcoin rewards credit card now as well. It's 2-3% cash back on everything, so it's better than most other cards out there too.

I nearly have more bitcoin for the bitcoin I sold. I'm loving the market right now

bitcoin seems to dump harder than anything when times get tough

Can we have a new meme of btc at 67k or at 50k tomorrow pls

Do not look at ETH

btc taking the 67 meme too seriously T_T

>And before you say, well we went from $69k to $125k! Investing in the S&P500 during that same 4 year cycle also would have produced nearly a double up at a way lower risk case.

People just make up stuff.

https://testfol.io/?s=evJf4G8vp9w

Bitcoin return over last 4 years has been bad but not that bad.

S&P 500 is up 56% since the 2021 Bitcoin high.
At the peak Bitcoin as up 80%, now it us up 8%.

Bitcoin doesn't have millions of people automatically putting money into it every 2 weeks.

> when is the big time coming?

Bitcoin is secure through its largest decentralized network and governance from proof of work. That beats “Free or cheap” options for people who care about wealth sovereignty.

Everyone remembers the pizza guy, so it's hard getting anyone to spend their Bitcoin these days.

I know plenty of people who bought stuff with crypto including myself maybe buying things with btc in 2018 wasn’t the brightest idea but we used it for what it’s suppose to be we’ll get there (I hope) lol

why not 6k?

The analysis follows a sharp drawdown of over 40% from Bitcoin’s all-time high of above $126,000

Scenario One: 80% Correction From the Peak  
The first scenario assumes Bitcoin repeats its deepest historical declines. An 80% drop from the $126,000 high would push the price toward $25,000.

Scenario Two: Return to Long-Term Averages  
The second scenario targets a move down to the 200-week moving average and realized price. These levels currently sit between $50,000 and $60,000.

Scenario Three: Support Above the Prior Cycle High  
The third path assumes a shallow bear market. Under this view, Bitcoin holds just above the previous cycle’s all-time high near $69,000, placing a potential floor around $70,000.

Scenario Four: Local Bottom Already Formed

If BTC does 3–4× from the bottom, that’s still a great outcome. The days of insane multiples are probably over, but that doesn’t mean it’s dead.

It's hilarious that people think that what happened previously to Bitcoin has any bearing on what will happen in the future.  It is an digital asset without real value or a real purpose.  The only guarantee for the future is that it will hit zero, the only question is when.

No!

For the narrative its very important that BTC keeps making ATH each cycle!.

Right now the trend seems like there will be no ATH next cycle, which would mean that it is basically dead 😅.

It was 3.7 or something i think..
Anyway tops are heavily diminishing while crashes stay heavy.

Not a good trend.

It's not looking good brav

If you look at it from ATH to ATH.
Them BTC was not able to do a 2x compared to previous cycle high.

Thats a very bleak picture. If this trend continues then you will be lucky if BTC even touches the 120k ATH of this cycle in 2029

I’d start stacking. Historically we bottom around last cycle’s high, in 2022 or whatever we dropped to ~16k when last high was 20k, last high was 69k so us being below indicates it could be a short buying window.  

Or we go lower, but if you still like BTC there’s a relevant reason to DCA from here

Turns out cycle boys were right all along.

Even quantitative easing, rising global liquidity, rate cuts, gulf state sovereign funds, institutions, M2 supply, etc.. and many going positive for crypto this past year, isn't enough to derail BTC's cycles.

BTC's volatility is inevitable.

I will buy BTC, ETH, SOL

We also have inflation to take care of, things are not looking good for Bitcoin all things considered, either next cycle explodes to 200-300k minimum or I don’t see it as a good long-term investment anymore.

I get why Bitcoin is dropping but why is Ethereum dropping harder? Seems to me ETH and XRP should be low key outperforming as we drop

He's crowd controlled since he's a 1 month old throwaway who constantly trolls

LARPs as a guy with millions of dollars in BTC and also LARPs shorting

Some people are just bored

BTC has gone through plenty of 70% retracements. A 70% pullback from $126k puts it around $37k. something to think about

$69k-$74k, a former resistance turned support zone. The sell off is intensifying, down 46% from ATH's, but the volatility feels oddly comforting. It’s what BTC used to do before the stagnancy. People were fleeing in Dec 2018, people were fleeing in 2021 and people are fleeing now. But every dip eventually becomes unrecognizable. The last time ETH was this oversold it went on to rally 300% in 2 months. BTC hit an ATH in April 2021 and fell 55% by July, only to short squeeze and rally 140%+ over the next 6 months. If it isn't in 2026, it'll be 2027

I haven't updated this from last November but it's probably worth glancing at to see where BTC might find support.  On the other hand, it might mean nothing.

Picked up some btc today, with more limit orders around 59-60k. Got still some dry powder if we drop to 50s.

BTC to 24k is possible I checked my charts

The question is, whether BTC will finally find support in the 60K range. It was the 60K range where it traded for most of 2024, until Trump won the election. We have been in the 60K range so many times in the last few years. I think if the bleeding stops in the 60K range, we could possibiy crab here for the next several months.

But that depends on whether support will be found in this range. If we drop below 60K, then all bets are off.

Yeah, BTC decoupled from stocks when the markets are going up and conveniently recouple when the markets retrace. 

Financial independence!!!

Me on twitter on 23 may, 2025 

""If you don't realize or understand that there is a very real possibility that Bitcoin price could fall to 30,000 usd or lower for some time, then you don't understand this market. 

Hint: shitcoin armageddon""

This is that shitcoin end of days aka armageddon 

I hope.

I’m kinda wondering this too. Is BTC really gonna go up 1000% again in such a short order? I have my doubts.

BTC Bottom at 48k to 54k ETH at 1500 to 1800

even if we go up now, we are still in bear cycle until those numbers start to appear.

If BTC ever came to $20k, whilst Saylor would be liquidated, the sellers would instantly lose.  
They would be selling their bitcoin to other buyers for much cheaper and make a huge loss in that regard,

""So I don't think BTC is following traditional markets"" such BS coming out of your every orifice, it is insane lmao.

If you were to tell anyone 3 weeks ago when BTC was at 97k that today it would be worth only 67k. Nobody would have believed you.

I know people are going to have different views on this... but the bear market was starting in December 2024.

I know people will say that's impossible because BTC made an ATH in October 2025 but if somebody is willing to look at the market as a whole with honesty...

> Btc dominance dumping along with price.

Educate yourself.

BTC dominance has gone up ~2% in the last 24 hours.  You have to exclude stablecoins.  If you include stablecoins, it looks like it's going down as stablecoins become a larger and larger percentage of marketcap.

If BTC can’t hold 67k, give or take 10%, I’m not feeling optimistic about any buy price. I’d go back to stocks before contemplating suffering through another bull cycle like this. 70-80% draw downs weren’t a big deal when BTC was amassing huge thousand % gains but after the halving, Bitcoin is seeing a few hundred percent appreciation which means the next cycle will only see maybe a 100% gains which is still ok but considering mag 7 stocks are making the same amount of gains if not more with much less risky downside, I would feel like an idiot if I willingly subject myself to another 4 years of crypto. Plus, the alt coin market has been in a bear market since 2021, crypto just feels like a giant wealth transfer scam more then it does a hedge against inflation

btcd going down yaay alt season

![gif](giphy|P3ataVxTgFOimQeC0S)

The dump it's been brutal, not a single bounce.

I don't know if it's still worth buying Bitcoin in the long term considering that the gains on the upswings are getting smaller and smaller but in bear markets the dumps will continue to be brutal just like in previous cycles.

To put it in context, in the previous bear market cycle, Bitcoin took until the end of 2022 to fall below the 2017 all-time high, marking the cycle's bottom. In this one, we've only been down for four months and we're already below the 2021 all-time high.

So far so good the great 2k ETH support level…

it's obvious what's going on… u.s. government is making gold prices go up and bitcoin prices fall because U.S. government is quietly selling its gold reserve to buy bitcoin cheap… the gold reserve is being replaced with digital gold

If you bought ETH 4 years ago you've made no money

If btc keeps dumping with no relief rallies, im going to have to assume this is the case.

Btc dominance dumping along with price. Weird bear market vibes

They’re responsible for the oct 10th crash and have been the biggest btc seller since then. But whenever anyone asks them what has happened they put the blame on someone else

He tweeted the very same word on 4th of August 2024 when bitcoin fell below 50k. People here advised to sell in order to buy back at 40k. Guess who gave better advice?

The sentiment is pretty weak. At this rate, we'll be in the 50K range within a few days, maybe even by tomorrow.

Not sure if there will even be strong support in the 50K range. I would have thought there is support in the 60K range, since BTC more or less spent most of 2024 crabbing in the 60K range, until Trump won the election. But at the rate BTC price is dropping, it looks like it won't be in the 60K range for long and we'll be in the 50K range pretty soon.

I do hope there will be some support if we get to the 50K range.  But it seems the market is pretty fearful of BTC right now, and a lot of people just want to dump their BTC holdings.

October 10th is when BTC decoupled from everything in the worst way possible.

BTC yes, crypto in general NO

It's so weird seeing bitcoin at 67k. The feeling of deja vu and exhaustion. It's more less the price at the date of last halving.

HOLY SHIT BTC HIT MY BUY PRICE OF 67K

DONT DROP ANYMORENPLS

I saw people here saying that the next time there was a ""1"" at the front of ETH, it would be in front of 10,000.

Show yourselves.

Not at all unprecedented. BTC has crashed 20% in a single day many times before.

Because if they hit liquidation, it will affect the price in a big way.

Haven't you noticed that the price just dropped by over $10K in a short time? Thanks to the acceleration by longs closing their positions and having to sell Bitcoin by the millions.

What happened, though? 

Did the interest on Japanese bonds go 0.00001% higher? 

Did Trump tweet some nonsense? 

Is any of those two things extraordinary enough to kill BTC?

This is why you have to stick to BTC and ETH, ETH is already at $1965 already just strong support because most ofthe supply  is locked

Remember when this sub was full of comments predicting 10k and 15k eth?

Now wait for saylor to sell, btc under 10k soon

30k was always on the menu just like sub 1k Ethereum.

As for me a BTC holder I sleep like a baby at night. Waking up every 3 hours crying.

60,000 gone from BTC in a few days

Looks like ETH is starting to rally

This speed is unprecedented. Bitcoin down 24k in 8 days

Bitcoin was built by Jeffrey Epstein

No no, Bitcoin is definitely dead again because some WSBers invested in MSTR and line go down

Half the time it does the opposite of stocks. And I also don't remember traditional markets crashing every 4 years, and then having big bullruns every 4 years. So I don't think BTC is following traditional markets when it does that.

And I've just used Bitcoin twice already this week for payments, so I can confirm, it still works for everyday payments.

Yea we're cooked. Worst part is that alts generally feel the full force of a dump after bitcoin dumps and then chops

Keep in mind that in the middle of 2021, Bitcoin went down by over 50% and then bounced back to $69K.

Right now we're down 47.6%.

I don't think we have a repeat of 2021. It looks more like the usual plunge into a bear winter.

Whales mass dumping together. It's always like this in a bear market.

Yeah but BTC is gunna hit 100k at the end of 2021. Have sum faith!!

Ok, you got a good laugh out of me on that one, I'll admit it

But in reality I literally don't care about market cap for anything, it has the same justification for trillions of dollars of marketcap as all sorts of nonsense stocks combining for trillions of marketcap which don't produce anything but people degen into constantly

Bitcoin is the same for me as it was when I started, it had a 16 billion marketcap then, just more people yelling about it now

Damnnnn.    Eth under 2k

My totally uneducated guess is BTC will rebound at 20k

is there even a reason for this? its not like a large exchange has gone bankrupt or something

If you bought BTC in 2021 (5 years ago), you would be just below evens and DOWN about 25% after inflation.

It's like this at the end of every bull market. I remember the same thing happening in 2021 Bitcoin went -50% in one month and that was the start of the bear market.

Queuing up games and checking yield farms, what kind of Star Trek shit is that? On a serious note, those sorts of use cases justify trillions of dollar market cap for btc? We both know the answer to this

Eth sub 0.3k

I told ya. Ethereum sub 1k.

So basically BTC shits the bed regardless of what happens any where else

While you were typing that no one uses it I'm literally queuing up games like I do every day and checking my yield farms which are going insane lol

Like I said, you not using something ≠ no one is using it, coming here to tell people who are literally using it is like me going over to /r/tax and telling them T2s have no use because I don't personally file any

Been here 5 years, bought all the way down in 2022, but it still amazes me at the speed Bitcoin is falling

Umm no the maxis said “hold only as much USD as you can afford to lose” and then told anyone who wasn’t all in that they “don’t truly understand bitcoin” or “haven’t studied bitcoin enough”

Interesting how now the advice shifts to “don’t forget to fund your 401k!”

Yeah sure Bitcoin died again. Look at this

https://bitcoindeaths.com/

Bitcoin correlates with what the market does most of the time ... except that when stock market goes up, bitcoin does not, lol.

I have never seen anything like this. Literally 30k down in three weeks. 60k down in four months. Even Trump rally lasted 40 days during which bitcoin rose by 36k.

https://bitcoindeaths.com/

Yes Bitcoin is death again.

You got 10 more months to go, just sell and get it over with. Hopefully something will be left by November to keep BTC alive. If not, just go to the mag 7. Nvidia is gonna rip thanks to ai

if btc goes to $20k ill consider buying again

sub 2k eth here we go

There’s no way. BTC couldn’t even hold 69k, the previous cycle top. Retail and whales are gonna take this sucker to 50k by the end of February. Bulls are completely exhausted.

What's concerning is, SPX hasn't even made any large retracement so far. When that happens, how far down downs BTC go?

in leaked emails, tom lee was telling his customers ETH will drop sub 2000

Pack it up lads, [Bitcoin is dead again](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/)

- ~~BTC will never drop below previous cycle ATHs~~

- ~~BTC will not break into new ATHs until 6-9 months after halvening~~ 

We have slowly accepted that previous cycle rules that people used to repeat as mantra never existed.  We will cling on to cycle rules that still apply and say, the cycles are still playing out the same.

Crypto vets, myself included, have made money following the cycle patterns.  Many crypto vets who made big bets on Alts following cycle patterns lost a ton of money thinking big Alt seasons was coming in 2025.

Time will tell but I wouldn't be betting on the cyclic nature of Bitcoin as if it was written in the stars when it shows that it is breaking down as real world events and macro economic conditions have greater impacts than the smallar and smaller impacts of diminishing Bitcoin issuance due to halvenings.

Bitcoin just sliced through its previous all time high 69k like it was nothing! No support, nothing, as if it was just another number! Nothing is stopping Bitcoin from free-falling at this point

But you might feel bad when you only think about buying back over 100k. And then you'll think whether all of this opportunity cost was worth just some peace of mind for an interim period.

What is insane? Last time btc drew down 75%.

It could easily happen again

Crypto might actually be done this time. BTC has halved in the last 6 months and the news hasn't even been that bad. Def oversold but maybe people are just done with it.

ETH almost REKT.

Suddenly me selling all my btc at 75k doesn't feel so bad.

Sorry I misread your message. Yes he’s been pushing STRC pretty hard. He’s not making money off it though, he’s just using it to buy more BTC, which doesn’t have a yield where he can make money off the delta like banks do. It’s just more dilution he’ll have to do

It should also be noted that Microstrategy outlined a few months ago (after the October 2025 Flash Crash) under what circumstances they would sell Bitcoin. Which was a change from ""we will never sell Bitcoin"" mantra that they had held for five+ years.

>Second, MicroStrategy must be unable to raise new capital through equity or debt issuance. This would mean capital markets are closed or too expensive to access.

It should also be noted that Microstrategy outlined a few months ago (after the October 2025 Flash Crash) under what circumstances they would sell Bitcoin. Which was a change from ""we will never sell Bitcoin"" mantra that they had held for five+ years.

>First, the company’s stock must trade below 1x mNAV, meaning the market capitalization falls below the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

>Second, MicroStrategy must be unable to raise new capital through equity or debt issuance. This would mean capital markets are closed or too expensive to access.

As far as I can tell the first part has already happened. Now the question is will the second part happen?

Agreed, it is hard to understand the financial structure and that's why I think there is still an edge to be had. Information asymmetry. 

That being said, the only thing I'm interested in is STRK. I think over a very long time horizon the common will do well, but its the relief valve when they need or want cash. There is no limit to the total dilution, even if their goal is increasing BTC per share.

If you think of Strategy almost like their own central bank, MSTR common is basically their currency, and they can issue as much as they need.

Back to STRK. The dividend is fixed at 8%, which becomes 10% when buying at $80, and gets better as the price goes down. The fixed interest provides upwards pressure as the share price decreases and the interest rate rises. At the same time, you can still participate in the long-term blow-off thesis due to the convertibility at $1,000 (10 to 1). 

I've owned STRK from the beginning, and have added to it every time its below $80. When the price goes up, great. When it goes down, I'm earning 10%+ while I wait for bitcoin to do the long-term thing I think it will.

The primary risk is the entirety of Strategy blowing up, but I still see that as low probability. While everyone has watched their MSTR drop by 75%, my STRK is down a couple dollars on average, and each share pays me $2 every three months.

It's a long way of saying I believe the best risk/reward in Strategy is actually outside the common stock. STRK wins in either direction, as long as they stay in business.",315,0.84,279,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qvugaa/serious_microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_their/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qvugaa/serious_microstrategy_is_now_underwater_on_their/,neutral,"Mixed discussion of risks and potential gains, no clear overall positive or negative tone"

Just thinking about BTC, ETH, SOL, CHAIN ?

**Here is the reality of the ""Crypto News"" cycle:**

* The 62% Scam Rate: Over half of the releases we tracked came from entities that were actually confirmed scams, rug-pulls, or high-risk ""ghost"" projects.
* The ""Trophy URL"" Trap: Scammers aren't paying for readers, they are paying for the URL. They use that link to ""game"" Google’s Knowledge Graph and appear legitimate in search results. It’s a ""reputation laundry"" service.
* Zero Substance: Only 2% of releases actually covered real events like funding or major partnerships. The other 98% were just hype designed to trigger FOMO.

**How to protect yourself (DYOR 2.0):**

1. Ignore the Logos: A ""Bloomberg"" or ""Yahoo Finance"" link is often just a paid press release (look for ""Paid Content"" or ""Sponsored"" in tiny text). It is NOT editorial endorsement (=anyone with some money to spare can say almost anything they want and it'll get ""published"").
2. Check the ""Omitted Results"": If you search for the project and Google says ""results omitted,"" it means the ""news"" is just syndicated spam that provides zero value.
3. The ""Lights On"" Test: If a project has ""Tier-1 news"" but their parking lot is empty (zero github activity, no real team on LinkedIn, no actual utility), this is a HUGR red flag.

I’m sharing this because the ""Press Release Pump"" is the new version of the 90s penny stock scam. Don't let a ""reputable"" URL trick you into a rug pull.

However, by early 2026 the situation had flipped. 

According to CryptoQuant analysts, derivatives now make up 75% to 80% of the entire crypto market volume, leaving spot trading a mere quarter of the turnover. The leverage inherent in futures famously contributed to the 2008 stock market crash, and the crypto sphere is now repeating that path, but with far greater risks.

**The Domination of Perpetual Contracts**

A particular problem emerged with the rise of perpetual swaps. Unlike traditional contracts, they have no expiry date. According to Cryptomus analysts, the structure of the derivatives market today looks severely skewed: Perpetual futures account for \~78% of total derivatives trading volume. Traditional (fixed-term) futures hold only the remaining share, mostly in the institutional sector (CME).

The perpetual model allows speculators to hold positions indefinitely, thanks to the funding rate mechanism. Perpetuals have become a tool even for former holders who abandoned spot for synthetic positions, creating an illusion of liquidity.

**Deadly Grids and Liquidation Cascades**

Holders are a vital element of the ecosystem. Previously, they used the DCA (dollar-cost averaging) strategy, but the shift to perpetuals turned this into dangerous Grid trading or even Martingale systems. Why are grids dangerous? They generate profit during flat periods or trends, but sharp corrections lead to accumulating positions against the market, resulting in margin calls.

The year 2025 clearly showed the scale of the disaster:

 **•**  October 2025 (""The 1011 Crash""): On October 10–11, geopolitical shocks triggered the largest cascade of liquidations in history. Approximately $19.89 billion worth of positions were forcibly closed over 48 hours. At the peak on October 10, $3.21 billion evaporated in a single minute.

   **•** November 2025: The market hadn't recovered, and subsequent liquidation waves wiped out another roughly $5–7 billion in open interest.

**The Current Situation: Early 2026**

Bitcoin is currently falling for the 4th month in a row, threatening to surpass the negative records of 2018. January 2026 only confirmed the system's fragility:

  **•** January 31, 2026: $2.56 billion in positions were liquidated in a single day, with over $2.4 billion of that being long positions.

  **•**  Early February 2026: The BTC price dropped to the $74,500 – $78,000 range, which is 40% below the October 2025 highs of $126,100.

The situation is worsened by the near-total disappearance of traditional futures. When the market is dominated by perpetuals with massive leverage, any 5% dip can turn into a multi-day 15% crash due to automatic liquidations that no one is there to buy, as there is less and less ""real"" spot capital in the system.","Will Perpetual Futures Be the Death of the Crypto Market?

1qujxy3,CryptoCurrency,aminok,1770098130.0,2026-02-03T13:55:30+08:00,Ethereum consensus as an exportable commodity via restaking,"The simplest way to understand restaking is **Security-as-a-Service**.

Ethereum is not exporting its settlement layer, execution environment, or governance. What is actually being exported is **validator work** — the willingness of thousands of nodes to follow a rule set, put capital at risk, and sign data in exchange for yield. Restaking turns ETH from a passive asset into an **active economic primitive** that other systems can potentially rely on.

That shift is primarily economic rather than philosophical.

---

## Why this is attractive: reducing fragmented security budgets

A large portion of crypto infrastructure faces the same constraint:  
establishing native security is expensive and operationally heavy.

Launching a chain, oracle, or bridge traditionally meant assembling a new validator set, issuing a token, and sustaining ongoing incentives just to maintain baseline security. Restaking introduces another path: **compensate Ethereum-aligned validators rather than creating a new security system from scratch.**

If this model scales, it does not eliminate tokens, but it can change where they are necessary. The core appeal is capital reuse rather than capital creation.

---

## Who is actually renting this security?

**Mantle (Cost Reduction)**  
Mantle decoupled execution from data availability and offloaded DA to EigenDA rather than posting full data to Ethereum L1. The result is lower per-transaction cost while maintaining Ethereum alignment. It functions as a case study in **cost optimization**.

**Celo (Validator Cost Compression)**  
Celo’s transition from an independent L1 to an Ethereum L2 blockchain provides a measurable benchmark. As a standalone Layer 1, Celo subsidized approximately 110 validators at an estimated annual cost near **$6.5 million**, or roughly **$0.02 per transaction** based on reported throughput. Migrating to L2 and externalizing data availability reduces this recurring security expenditure while preserving its low-fee payment model. The significance is not alignment alone, but the removal of a persistent validator subsidy requirement.

**MegaETH (Throughput Constraint)**  
MegaETH targets extremely high throughput and low latency. Its architecture separates node responsibilities and cannot rely on standard Ethereum L1 data posting without constraining performance. EigenDA operates as a high-throughput storage layer, indicating that for performance-oriented chains, externalized data availability may be a structural requirement rather than an optimization.

---

## How restaking enforces behavior

Restaking is strongest when misbehavior is **objectively provable**.

Double-signing, invalid state transitions, or broken signature thresholds can be detected and penalized without interpretation. When failures become subjective — ambiguous downtime, disputed data quality, unclear attribution — enforcement tends to rely more on governance or adjudication rather than purely automated slashing.

This creates a practical boundary:

- Some services can be strictly verifiable.
- Others retain elements of social or institutional trust at their edges.

---

## Restaking is not identical to traditional shared-security models

Restaking differs from Cosmos-style or Polkadot-style shared security in control structure and coupling.

In conventional shared-security systems, the base chain often governs validator policy and slashing conditions directly. In restaking models, external services define their own requirements and operators opt in. The result is typically more diversity of approaches, with more market-driven development, and obviously less uniformity/standardization in architecture.

---

## The bear case: leverage and correlated exposure

The primary risk is structural.

If the same staked ETH secures multiple services, a major slashing event or coordinated failure could create correlated losses across those services. The mechanism that produces capital efficiency — reuse of the same underlying stake — is also what introduces potential contagion. However, EigenLayer provides several avenues for mitigating these risks, like limiting how much slashing-adjusted capital one lot of restaked ETH can secure simultaneously.

---


**Conclusion**

Restaking demonstrably functions as a mechanism for reallocating validator effort and capital. It debundles security from the blockchain, to turn it into yet another module that any crypto system can employ for a fee.","Ethereum consensus as an exportable commodity via restaking

That’s simple, but it treats a euphoric top the same as a panic bottom. If you imagine “risk” on a 0 - 100 scale (0 = coolest, 100 = hottest), classic DCA keeps buying from 0 through 100 with the same size. In my 2022-now backtest, that blind approach landed about 18%/year, respectable, but indifferent to conditions.

Now add one simple rule: set a “balance point” at risk 50 and pause buys when risk >= 50. Same constant size below 50, zero above it. During the same period, that tiny bit of risk-awareness lifted results to roughly 25%/year, and it actually invested \~$5k less than the blind DCA because we skipped the hotter stretches.

[Adding Stop buying rule](https://preview.redd.it/o2ug7gef55hg1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=be76b135e63e3ff168d69a593137fdb751ac8c60)

Next, fix that under-investment, nudge sizing with the risk bands. Example “linear ramp”:

* risk < 50 -> buy $100
* risk < 40 -> buy $200
* risk < 30 -> buy $300, and so on.

In the same timeframe, that “buy more when cooler” rule pushed results to about 31%/year. Capital is allocated where risk is lower, so each dollar works harder.

[Adding Linear Ramp](https://preview.redd.it/lwmxe9th55hg1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a9ac5b882c040701cfd9a31f5dd76a2379053b5)

Additional, If you are aggressive Bitcoin addicted, let's run the test ""exponential ramp"", double down each step:

* risk < 50 -> $100
* risk < 40 -> $200
* risk < 30 -> $400, etc.

That pushes total invested higher (much more invested amount than vanilla DCA ) and lifted the backtest to \~34% per year.The trade-off is obvious: better returns, higher capital commitment, and you must manage cash so you’re never forced to stop buying at the best moments. The % of yearly return will be much higher when Bitcoin moves up.

A few takeaways:

* Process beats prediction. Small rules, pause when hot, ramp when cool, compound edge without needing to call tops.
* Capital discipline matters. If you ramp, plan your budget so “cooler” bands actually have dollars waiting.
* Risk bands are a dial, not an oracle. They tell you how aggressively to participate, not whether the market will moon.

For a quick sanity check, I also tested a simple moving-average variant: use a 200D MA as a balance point and reduce/stop buys when price is extended well above it. Even that basic rule came out slightly better return % per year than blind DCA, same idea, fewer hot-zone buys.

This is how the ideal of improving DCA with a transparent, explainable risk measure on Bitcoin: start with constant DCA, add a pause above 50, then ramp sizing as risk cools.

Physical scarcity is a *temporary condition* set by current 1. extraction limits, 2. synthesis costs, and 3. substitutes. Over long time horizons, technology systematically reduces all three.

That matters because **stores of value only work if scarcity remains hard to erode**.

My view is simple:  
**If material abundance keeps compounding, enforced digital scarcity will dominate physical scarcity.**

## Why physical scarcity is not a stable foundation
People talk about gold, diamonds, and rare metals as if Earth's geology is the final word on their scarcity.

It is not. Technology is.

### Extraction vs enforced limits
Physical scarcity relies on difficulty of access.

That difficulty is conditional.

- Better surveying  
- Better automation  
- Better processing  
- Entirely new frontiers becoming viable, like m-class asteroids

Each step makes ""rare"" materials *less rare in economic terms*, even if they remain finite in theory.

Finite does not mean scarce enough to anchor value.

### Gems already show the failure mode
Diamonds are the best example because they have already experienced technology-induced abundance.

Once manufacturing produced indistinguishable diamond substitutes at scale, the scarcity premium collapsed. What remained is branding, signaling, and narrative.

That is not a monetary anchor, and this is proven by natural diamonds seeing their price decline 25-30% since 2022.

### Utility does not equal monetary premium
Another common argument is ""industrial use guarantees value"".

That is wrong.

Utility supports *floor demand*, not *monetary premium*. If substitutes appear or usage shifts, the premium evaporates.

History is full of materials that were once strategic, rare, and hoarded - until they were not. For instance aluminum, which before industrialized methods of processing, was more precious than gold.

Once supply increases, the asset drifts toward use-value pricing instead of monetary premium pricing.

That does not mean the thing becomes worthless.  
It means it becomes **bad at storing value over long horizons**.

## Rule-based scarcity beats physics
If material abundance keeps rising, scarcity shifts away from physics and toward **rule systems**.

This is the key transition people are missing.

Scarcity enforced by protocol rules is fundamentally different from scarcity enforced by geology, because it is completely immune to technology-induced abundance. Fiat shares this property with crypto, but it is instead vulnerable to political maneuvering, like leaders inflating their money supply to earn seigniorage.

In other words, crypto matters because **it creates enforced scarcity without relying on physical limits or political issuers**.

Not all crypto systems do this equally.

### The spectrum
- **Bitcoin:** fixed issuance enforced by consensus rules.  
- **Ethereum:** dynamic issuance with fixed inflation rate cap enforced by consensus, plus fee burning tied to real usage.  
- **Other L1s:** inflationary security models that dilute holders.  
- **Traditional assets:** scarcity enforced by law, courts, and governments.  

These are not equivalent systems. The tradeoffs matter.

## Why ETH is structurally different
Ethereum is not just an asset network. It is an economy.

And every economy has a settlement asset.

Inside Ethereum:
- ETH pays for execution.  
- ETH secures consensus.  
- ETH anchors liquidity and collateral.  

This creates a **monetary hierarchy** where ETH sits at the base.

Other assets exist *on top* of it.

That hierarchy is mechanical, so more durable than meme/culture based hierarchies.

## Settlement layers decide long-run value
I think this is the most important frame.

Value accrues to the layer where final balances reconcile.

Ethereum is increasingly that layer for:
- Stablecoins  
- DeFi  
- Tokenized assets  
- Rollups  

Layer 2 blockchains do not weaken this role. They reinforce it.

They push execution outward while pulling settlement inward.

That is exactly how financial systems scale.

## Why ETH and not BTC?
This is more speculative, but I'm of the opinion that the fundamentals make ETH far more likely to be a durable store of value.

**BTC has a built-in security budget cliff**. Bitcoin's issuance declines geometrically every four years, and fees have consistently remained a small fraction of miner revenue. That means the system is still overwhelmingly subsidy-funded. Over time, that subsidy mathematically goes to zero. Unless fees rise enough to replace it, security necessarily compresses. There is no alternative path in the design.

**ETH is explicitly built to avoid shrinking security over time**. Ethereum put a floor under its security model by ensuring issuance never goes to zero. Instead, supply growth adjusts upward slowly and predictably as staking participation rises, with a maximum theoretical inflation rate of about 1.5% ...[truncated]","Tech chipping away at physical scarcity makes ETH's protocol-enforced scarcity matter more

Here is some rough data typed out for you on what to expect based off prior BTC trends.

Anyone can go on trading view and set the chart on monthly and check these rough numbers themselves.

Please be aware that different exchanges and have different data but it shouldn't stray too far from what ive typed out.

Also I dont include the numbers before 2013 because the asset is very volatile and young at that point (still is today in my opinion). Exchanges have vastly different data for that period, some lacking.

Prior btc cycles:

Dec 2013 $1300 BTC (top)
Jan 2015 $200 BTC (bottom)

13 month difference

Dec 2017 $14000 BTC (top)
Jan 2019 $3000 BTC (bottom)

13 month difference 

Nov 2021 $61000 BTC
(top)
Dec 2022 $16000 BTC
(bottom)

13 month difference

Current btc cycle:

Oct 2025 $114000
(top)
Sept 2026 < 
(estimated bottom) $30000 - $40000

Note: I did not put the all time high wick data. Just the rough monthly close.

Below is price difference percentages for each cycle:

Value percentage difference between top and bottom:

2025- 28.0 - 30.0 % ?? Projected
2021- 26.2 %
2017- 22.1 %
2013- 15.1 %

I think bitcoin is doing literally what its always done.

Anyway, dont lose hope. Bitcoin is always dying and coming back to life.

Also I could be full of shit but long term holding and investing has always worked better for me than day trading.

we saw btc slice through 85k like it wasn't even there, hitting a low of around 83,300. but if you’re just looking at the price, you’re missing the actual story. this wasn't just a 'crypto dip' — it was a giant, mechanical margin call triggered by macro noise.

honestly, when microsoft drops 10% and the fed keeps rates at 3.5%+, crypto stops being 'uncorrelated.' it becomes the atm for every fund that needs to cover their tech losses. we aren't trading digital gold yet; we’re trading high-beta risk. when the kevin warsh news hit, the market basically priced in a liquidity squeeze, and the margin flush did the rest.

heres how i survived (and what u should probably change):

dont fall for the single point of failure trap. its the biggest mistake i see. people keep 100% of their money on one 'tier-1' exchange. then volatility spikes, the ui lags, and you're just watching your liquidation price get hit in slow motion.

i started keeping about 20% of my active collateral on a secondary venue as a side door. personally, i’ve been using bydfi for this lately. when the big platforms get overloaded or show those 'system busy' pop-ups, you need a backup that actually lets you manage your hedge or close a position. its not about brand loyalty, it’s about redundancy.

also, remember that liquidations are mechanical, not logical. once the 85k stop-loss hunt started, it became a feedback loop. price drops -> longs get liquidated -> forced market sells. if your position can’t survive a 'normal' 8% wick, you aren't positioning; you’re just gambling.

during that flush to 83k, the slippage was insane. if you tried to market-sell into that hole, you probably got filled at the absolute bottom. keep 'stink bids' deep in the order book instead.

so whats next? im watching the 80k-82k zone. if we don’t see open interest calm down here, we might have another leg lower.

Curious to hear from the survivors: did anyone actually manage to get an order through when it peaked? which platforms actually held up and which ones turned into a slideshow?

This cycle peak was already reached after an advance of only +94% and now is only up 20% since the halving. When the price drops though the 65k the current cycle went negative for the first time in the history of Bitcoin underlining the overall weakness. Just to put it in perspective, the last cycle had a better performce at the bottom of the bear market then this cycle peak.

If it actually is breaking down to this levels is not clear, but i do not like what i am observing here. I very much question if bitcoin will even reach its ATH in the next cycle. If you all can remember we already had a very unsual event the last bear market ( breaking the ATH of the previous 2018 cycle top at $20k) to the downside and now maybe printing the first ever negativ cycle overall.

I am in crypto as long as the age of this account and a little bit more then that. I hope now that all know that buy and hold for altcoins does not work, what if it will be the same for Bitcoin as well. I know why i bought back then and that still holds me in the market. It now only appears that I for the first time question my decision from a finaincal standpoint and I for sure cant be the only one starting to question all of this.

# How does Address Poisoning Happen?

I've talked about Address poisoning in other large theft posts. It's a spray and pray method used to target large wallets with predictable destination addresses.

It's unfortunate that some wallets don't have better security for these type of attacks. The hacker mimicked the first 6 and last 4 digits of the Intended Destination Address.

Here's a visual of what that looks like

* Fake Address - **0x6d90**52b2DF589De00324127fe2707eb34e59**2e48**
* Intended Destination Address - **0x6D90**CC8Ce83B6D0ACf634ED45d4bCc37eDdD**2E48** \- Galaxy Digital Deposit Address

[A look inside the user's wallet of 0xd6741220a947941bF290799811FcDCeA8AE4A7Da.](https://preview.redd.it/28xy7q4f9qgg1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5d7d15f2d13a7caa7f8c91b2edd36c044173021)

It appears the attacker was trying to poison the user's wallet for quite some time with tiny transactions of USDC.

The attacker sent numerous transactions hoping the victim will copy and paste the wrong address, which is exactly what happened.

* Total investment by hacker: About .04 cents
* Return on investment by hacker: 12.25M

# Following the Funds

This is a theft in progress. As I write this, the hacker is sending 100 ETH quantities into Tornado Cash.

The Main Hacker wallet of 0x6d9052b2DF589De00324127fe2707eb34e592e48 sent the entire balance of stolen funds to **0x49a21FC945312C6fB4f8C6C4D224E74A5B96e9DF**.

[The above image shows the flow of funds from the Victim's wallet --\> Hacker Wallet --\> Tornado Cash](https://preview.redd.it/gwrxwqvpeqgg1.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2ad8960b04d94d5063dfe204984d1cfbf86520c)

What's interesting is the wallet 0x49a...e9DF appears to be an intermediary for other address poisoning victims. The 12.25M theft appears to be by far the biggest single individual loss. 

The next highest appears to be about 31K in losses due to the same type of scam. I do have a destination address where I think some of the funds post Tornado Cash funds landed. I'll refrain from posting until further investigation and will post updates.

It's typically pretty hard to launder 12M without drawing the attention of law enforcement and the cybersecurity community.

# How to Prevent Address Poisoning to Your Wallet

* **Verify the Full Address:** The scammer can ONLY receive funds if you send them. Verify 2, 3, 4 times before sending funds. Oh and try to avoid sending when you're tired.
* **Use Address Book/Whitelist:** Utilize the address book feature in wallets verified addresses.
* **Avoid Historical Copy-Paste:** Don't copy and paste from your transaction history. Bad idea!
* **Use Proven Addresses:** Source recipient addresses. Again avoid transaction history as these attacks happen all too often!

Maxis may be swift saying I am stupid or some other violent way of dealing with the questioning. I have seen this with many critical comments and posts before. Or ""oh just another crypto-is-dead post"" and just shrug it off without actually debating anything. They will be ignored. 

But after what happened so far,  the most probable course of action will be that IF - at all - there will be a recovery, people will just sell as soon as they're in the profit zone. Or earlier in fear they might be dumped on before. Who is going to actually buy again in realization now that they might just be providing exit liquidity? 

Many memes circulated here with essentially people promising to take profits *this time* should prices go up again. 

Then there are all those profit-based investment vehicles which only will realize profits when they sell of course. 

Then there are zillions of tokens on a thin layer of investors. Obviously their value is way diluted,  and that is showing now. In itself that isn't too bad though, but a well-needed consolidation.

So how can crypto possibly ever actually really be roaring again? On what grounds? I am after some fundamental economic reasons, not just vague cycles or ""when people buy again"".

It rather feels like the collapse of a tulip mania, and no wishing that your precious tulips were worth millions again made those wishes come true.

Where is the actual fundamental need for crypto which might make it different from tulips?

There is only one I can think of. That's economic mayhem. And the need for alternative ways of currency circulation. 

But we are in that already and people flock to gold and silver instead! So that argument doesn't even seem to hold. The store of value argument is questionable at best.

Now gold and silver aren't very liquid and fungible in the sense of easy to transact with. That might be the only way crypto regains appeal. But that is the rather medium of exchange function, where are the odds that it will be adopted?

But even that scenario is dark. Very few people actually use crypto. There's no political power behind it also. Money is and has always been a societal control device by the powerful entity of the time. Minted royal coins, national currencies, fiat. That's why the central banks lost their fear of bitcoin. 

So what real scenario can underpin a reviving of crypto?","Talk me out of thinking crypto is done - with arguments

Many memes circulated here with essentially people promising to take profits *this time* should prices go up again. 

Then there are all those profit-based investment vehicles which only will realize profits when they sell of course. 

Then there are zillions of tokens on a thin layer of investors. Obviously their value is way diluted,  and that is showing now. In itself that isn't too bad though, but a well-needed consolidation.

So how can crypto possibly ever actually really be roaring again? On what grounds? I am after some fundamental economic reasons, not just vague cycles or ""when people buy again"".

It rather feels like the collapse of a tulip mania, and no wishing that your precious tulips were worth millions again made those wishes come true.

Where is the actual fundamental need for crypto which might make it different from tulips?

There is only one I can think of. That's economic mayhem. And the need for alternative ways of currency circulation. 

But we are in that already and people flock to gold and silver instead! So that argument doesn't even seem to hold. The store of value argument is questionable at best.

Now gold and silver aren't very liquid and fungible in the sense of easy to transact with. That might be the only way crypto regains appeal. But that is the rather medium of exchange function, where are the odds that it will be adopted?

But even that scenario is dark. Very few people actually use crypto. There's no political power behind it also. Money is and has always been a societal control device by the powerful entity of the time. Minted royal coins, national currencies, fiat. That's why the central banks lost their fear of bitcoin. 

So what real scenario can underpin a reviving of crypto?",65,0.67,329,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qs7f6a/talk_me_out_of_thinking_crypto_is_done_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qs7f6a/talk_me_out_of_thinking_crypto_is_done_with/,negative,Expresses skepticism and doubt about crypto's future

I was initially offered an 8.3% settlement early on. In hindsight, I probably should have taken it. At the time, I didn’t agree with the clawback process on principle and made the decision to fight it if it came to that.

Recently, I received a notice that there was an entry of default in my case. Between that, the stress of everything, and having a baby on the way, I’m starting to feel like continuing to fight this may not be worth it.

My main question is this:

Has anyone successfully gone back to Celsius or the Litigation Administrator and been able to settle closer to their original offer after initially declining? If so, what did that process look like?

I’m also trying to understand whether legal representation actually improves outcomes and would appreciate hearing real experiences with the following:

Roland Jones

Dan Brisikof

DOF Defense Group

For context, I’ve heard Roland Jones typically asks for a retainer north of $4k, and I know some early Celsius clients who worked with him ended up settling closer to 12%.

DOF Defense Group quoted $500 upfront plus 1% of the final settlement amount, which seems more manageable, but I haven’t found many firsthand experiences yet.

I haven’t heard much at all about Dan Brisikof, good or bad, so I’m especially curious if anyone has worked with him.

I fully expect to pay something. I’m just trying to understand what’s realistic and whether hiring counsel meaningfully changed the settlement percentage or process.

Is anyone here handling this themselves without an attorney? If so, how is that going?

I know this situation has impacted a lot of people. For those who lost money and are dealing with real financial damage, I genuinely empathize. I personally lost a significant amount in Vauld as well. Ironically, I moved funds from Celsius to Vauld because the yields were higher, so this has been a double hit. I’m not really in a position to throw a lot of money at legal fees or a large settlement.

One of the few days I wish I could go back to and change my response was an evening around 2010–2011 when I was still in high school.

A guy on my street told me about something called Bitcoin. He said it was money on the internet and asked if I wanted to buy some. I laughed because it sounded ridiculous at the time. I depended completely on my parents for food, transport, and school project fees, so spending money on something I couldn’t see or touch made no sense to me. He mentioned that if I had about ₦10,000, I could buy a lot of it. I looked at him, shook my head, and walked away.

I forgot about that conversation.

Years later, around 2016, when I started learning about crypto and understood what Bitcoin really was, that memory came rushing back. I saw how far the price had gone, and that was when the regret started.

But instead of learning the right lesson from that regret, I reacted emotionally.

I told myself I would never miss out again.

So I started jumping into every new token I heard about. If it was trending, I bought it. If people were talking about it online, I entered. I didn’t read. I didn’t research. I didn’t understand what I was buying. I was trying to make up for the Bitcoin I didn’t buy years ago.

In reality, I was gambling.

I lost a lot of money this way. Money that took me time to save. Then I moved to memecoins, thinking quick pumps would help me recover faster, but most times I entered late or held too long, and the losses continued.

That was when I had to be honest with myself.

I didn’t miss Bitcoin because I didn’t have ₦10,000 in 2011. I missed Bitcoin because I didn’t understand how to recognize value, how to be patient, and how to think long term.

And years later, I was repeating the same mistake in a different way by letting regret push me into bad decisions.

That realization changed how I approach crypto completely.

Now, before I buy anything, I slow down. I read about the project. I try to understand what problem it is solving. I check who is behind it. I study the tokenomics. I ask myself if this still makes sense without the hype. If I can’t answer these questions, I stay away.

I still think about that ₦10,000 conversation sometimes, but I no longer let it control how I invest.

Because I’ve learned that missing one opportunity is not the real problem.

The real problem is allowing the regret of that missed opportunity to control your future decisions.

Today, with thousands of projects launching almost every day and noise everywhere, it’s easy to feel like you are late again. But now I move with patience, discipline, and due diligence.

The real lesson from missing Bitcoin was not about the money I didn’t make. It was about learning not to let regret control my investments.

And if you’ve ever felt like you missed out too, remember this: there will always be new opportunities ahead. What matters most is the mindset you carry into them. Learn the lesson, stay patient, do your research, and don’t rush decisions out of fear. You are not late, you are just early to the next opportunity, this time with wisdom.","Don’t Let Regret Control Your Investments

So I started jumping into every new token I heard about. If it was trending, I bought it. If people were talking about it online, I entered. I didn’t read. I didn’t research. I didn’t understand what I was buying. I was trying to make up for the Bitcoin I didn’t buy years ago.

In reality, I was gambling.

I lost a lot of money this way. Money that took me time to save. Then I moved to memecoins, thinking quick pumps would help me recover faster, but most times I entered late or held too long, and the losses continued.

That was when I had to be honest with myself.

I didn’t miss Bitcoin because I didn’t have ₦10,000 in 2011. I missed Bitcoin because I didn’t understand how to recognize value, how to be patient, and how to think long term.

And years later, I was repeating the same mistake in a different way by letting regret push me into bad decisions.

That realization changed how I approach crypto completely.

Now, before I buy anything, I slow down. I read about the project. I try to understand what problem it is solving. I check who is behind it. I study the tokenomics. I ask myself if this still makes sense without the hype. If I can’t answer these questions, I stay away.

I still think about that ₦10,000 conversation sometimes, but I no longer let it control how I invest.

Because I’ve learned that missing one opportunity is not the real problem.

The real problem is allowing the regret of that missed opportunity to control your future decisions.

Today, with thousands of projects launching almost every day and noise everywhere, it’s easy to feel like you are late again. But now I move with patience, discipline, and due diligence.

The real lesson from missing Bitcoin was not about the money I didn’t make. It was about learning not to let regret control my investments.

And if you’ve ever felt like you missed out too, remember this: there will always be new opportunities ahead. What matters most is the mindset you carry into them. Learn the lesson, stay patient, do your research, and don’t rush decisions out of fear. You are not late, you are just early to the next opportunity, this time with wisdom.",13,0.71,17,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qrj3xk/dont_let_regret_control_your_investments/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qrj3xk/dont_let_regret_control_your_investments/,positive,"Reflective, encouraging, optimistic about learning and future opportunities."

We've all seen how many Satoshi era wallets have been selling. Whales are not dumb, they need enough exit liquidity to not crash the markets. Everytime BTC goes up, it gets sold off. Saylor buys then the price magically drops. Rinse repeat.

Something just feels off and Saylor is a snake, through and through. He's making rich and power friends and bleeding his shareholders dry.

\*Edit 2: just easier than commenting on every post. OTC is reciprocal it's not some magical place where sellers and buyers are always waiting. If someone wants to sell OTC they need someone who wants to buy OTC.

We've all seen how many Satoshi era wallets have been selling. Whales are not dumb, they need enough exit liquidity to not crash the markets. Everytime BTC goes up, it gets sold off. Saylor buys then the price magically drops. Rinse repeat.

Something just feels off and Saylor is a snake, through and through. He's making rich and power friends and bleeding his shareholders dry.

\*Edit: before you take offense, read the last sentence again. This is bad for MSTR shareholders. For BTC? You could argue it's at least keeping the price up in a potential bear market.\*

  
\*Edit 2: just easier than commenting on every post. OTC is reciprocal it's not some magical place where sellers and buyers are always waiting. If someone wants to sell OTC they need someone who wants to buy OTC. It doesn't directly affect the price, but if the OTC buyers aren't there then people would be forced to sell on exchanges and the price would plummet. Saylor is likely one of the only entities proving OTC buying at this time",151,0.82,103,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qqbsgr/strategy_is_providing_exit_liquidity_for_whales/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qqbsgr/strategy_is_providing_exit_liquidity_for_whales/,negative,"Criticism of Strategy and Saylor, accusing them of harming shareholders."

This one is quite fuddy but I hope you can tell it comes from a place of concern and mourning, not malice.

It’s a real shame that not even Bitcoin seems to be worth putting money into anymore, at least not as much as other assets, with current events putting its long marketed narrative of being a hedge or safe haven against fiat inflation to a real-time, real-world test (after its original narrative of being a currency failed to materialize), and showing that it may well in fact not even serve as that after all either.

I’m not writing this as a bear; it genuinely makes me sad to see the state of crypto after having been in the space in those earlier days. I wish Bitcoin was pumping with gold right now, proving the narrative of being a safe haven to be true, so I could feel good about starting to accumulate a position again at some point.

This doesn’t change the fact that Bitcoin is a pristine, immutable, censorship-resistant asset, Eth is still the world computer offering invaluable decentralized financial services to the unbanked, and Monero is true digital cash, just to name a few.

But, this is just another hole being shown in one of the many narratives of crypto that have been spouted over the years and I hope more people are realizing that some of the things that “nocoiners” have been saying do have some merit, even if it might not be for the same reasons they are/were saying it, as disappointed as I am to say this.

I’ve been a part of the space since early 2017 starting out as an eth miner, building GPU rigs. I’ve made lots of mistakes and no I’m not rich now despite having discovered crypto that early, bc of said mistakes.

That being said, I did make a decent amount of money in the space during the 2020-2021 bull market.

Naive me “got back” into the space in Dec 2024 on beliefs of the cycle being on the full upswing again. Lost a lot of money leverage trading on Hyperliquid, and I kind of rejected crypto from that point on, partially because of the losses but mainly from having “seen the light” that was triggered by that event, that most of crypto is vaporware despite there genuinely being real-world use cases for it, amongst other things.

I guess that was a blessing in disguise, since I became a tradfi normie and went back into the stock market at the beginning of last year and have since made up for those losses and then some.

Why am I writing all of this? I guess just to share my story and perspective, as someone who was here maybe not in the “early days” like pre-2016, but earlier days than now.

I might go back to accumulating a small position of Bitcoin at some point just for the fun spirit of it, but it seems pretty clear that its touted position of being “digital gold” doesn’t seem to be holding much water, at least at this point in time.

Or maybe it’ll go to the moon and I’ll eat my words :)","Bitcoin’s most recently bestowed narrative as a safe-haven asset is showing cracks?

The industry keeps arguing about throughput and fees while ignoring the number that actually kills chains: **operating expenses**.

There is a structural reality most people still do not internalize:

**Running an Ethereum L2 is on the order of \~99% cheaper than running a sovereign L1.**

This has been widely attested to, most recently by Celo founder Marek. [1]

This is a consequence of how security is paid for. And once you see this, the outcome for most independent L1s is obvious.

# Sovereignty Is a Fixed Cost

Launching a sovereign L1 is not just building software. It is committing to permanently fund your own security budget.

You must pay validators every block:

* for consensus,
* for availability,
* for attack resistance.

That cost does not care about usage.

Whether the chain processes millions of transactions or none at all, the validator set still has to be paid. The network cannot ""idle.""

In bull markets, token prices hide this. In bear markets, the subsidy collapses while the security bill does not.

**Sovereign L1s have fixed costs with variable revenue.** That mismatch is fatal.

# L2s Flip the Cost Model

An Ethereum L2 blockchain does not maintain its own standing security force. It outsources finality.

Execution happens off-chain. Only proofs and data are posted to Ethereum.

This creates a completely different cost structure:

* **Sovereign L1:** pays for security continuously.
* **Ethereum L2:** pays for security only when it settles.

If an L2 has no users, it posts nothing. Its marginal cost drops close to zero. There is no requirement to keep producing blocks for an empty chain.

It can pause without dying.

That single property explains most of the ""99% difference"".

# Fixed vs Variable Survival

**Sovereign L1s**

* Own the security stack
* Fixed burn rate
* Require constant subsidy
* Fail when markets turn

**Ethereum L2s**

* Rent settlement
* Usage-linked costs
* Can shrink to zero activity
* Survive indefinitely

This is not a matter of better engineering. It is basic cost structure.

# Why Settlement Consolidates

Once sovereignty is understood as an ongoing liability, outsourcing security becomes the rational choice.

But security can only be rented from something that is itself economically durable.

You cannot anchor to a chain that depends on perpetual token inflation to survive. You cannot settle to a layer whose own security budget is fragile.

You need a settlement layer with:

* the highest economic security,
* no dependency on short-term revenue,
* and credible neutrality.

That narrows the field dramatically.

This is why settlement keeps consolidating onto Ethereum. Not because of ideology, branding, or culture, but because it is the only place where offloading security actually reduces existential risk.

# Bottom Line

Kadena did not fail because it lacked ideas. It failed because it carried a fixed security cost into a type of market where fixed costs kill you.

The \~99% cost gap means that the vast majority of crypto platforms in the future will be Ethereum-based L2 blockchains.

In the long run, chains either externalize security to a dominant settlement layer, or they exhaust themselves paying for sovereignty no one is using.

I would like to ask and start a discussion in terms of **Ethereum** and **Solana** and how they fare against each other. Growth is still a factor here, but exposure is much more important to me right now, which directly translates into growth long-term.  

# Context  

I feel like right now we are in a phase of a heavy transition into a future, like we only had it during the **"".com Bubble""**. The transition includes major technologies like **AI** but also **Blockchains** and thus Cryptocurrencies as a whole. The reason that this feeling is stronger than before, is that banks and financial institutions started to see Cryptocurrencies as a liability to their business model, since **yields** are much higher, when invested into a **stablecoin**, compared to a **bank**.    

With the political and economical landscape right now being really rocky, we might experience one of the biggest wealth transfer in a long while in the coming 5 years. 

As a investor myself and also a technical guy, I want to have enough exposure into the right things, rather than gamble my life away. I don't believe to be one of the people that are the next ""Warren Buffett"", but my life-goal is to reach FIRE as young as possible, to life a self-fulfilling life. I don't really care about expensive materialistic stuff, but about the autonomy that wealth can buy, so supercars or even Yachts are entirely uninteresting for me. The goal is to reach FIRE with a yearly return enough to give a family of 4 a comfortable life. 

# Discussion points

In the current landscape there are mainly three major players that are talked about a lot in this space. The first one being   


* Bitcoin - for obvious reasons and being the grandfather of cryptocurrencies
* Ethereum - as a major player and currently the main candidate to be the future world computer 
* Solana - the younger competitor of Ethereum with a theoretical throughput of about 10x that of Ethereum

Ethereum is often cited as the battle-tasted stable system in the space, while trying to fulfill a solution to the Blockchain trilemma, namely ""**Decentralization**"", ""**Scalability**"" and ""**Security**"". Vitalik Buterin very recently said, that they finally solved the trilemma and rolling out a solution mid-year in the ""**Glamsterdam**"" upgrade, which nudges Ethereum closer to the final solution.   
Ethereum heavily relies on L2 solutions compared to having everything on the main chain. The mainchain is said to reach 10k TPS after the upgrade with L2s reaching 100k+ TPS, which is already well above today's levels with for example Visa. 

Solana on the other hand is frequently cited as the high-throughput powerhouse of the ecosystem, engineered specifically as a ""monolithic"" architecture that prioritizes speed and low costs. It compromises on security and thus doesn't need many nodes to be down, for the Blockchain to be entirely down, but all of it is on the main chain.   
Solana wants to solve their reliability issues with the upgrade ""**Firedancer**"" which is also said to lift the throughput to a staggering 1M+ TPS in lab tests. 

From a security perspective, Ethereum is the clear winner for high value transactions since it's stability and security are second to none compared to Solana, while Solana is the clear winner for fast and low value retail transactions like monthly payments for example. 

From a technical and Blockchain purist view, Solana does seem like a ""fancier server"" with high risk of wealth being locked away forever. While Ethereum is not perfect in this regard, it adheres more to the purist philosophy of blockchain.   
Solana also does need insanely higher specs (\~6+ cores, 256GB+ RAM, 10Gbps symmetric internet) compared to Ethereum (technically runs on a Raspberry Pi) to have a node, while 32 Ethereum isn't that low anymore too. 

# Verdict

From the perspective of maturity and stability Ethereum does clearly win the race of being the global backbone of the futures financial system, especially with Blackrocks BUIDL PoC among other projects.    
Investors start to treat it more like a ""**blue chip investment**"" nowadays tho, since while L2 solutions are one of the biggest strengths of Ethereum, it's also on of the biggest hampers to growth and is is seen as reliable and stable ""slow investment"". L2 solutions don't really need Ethereum as fuel, which is why a lot of things can be done extremely cheap or in a way that bypasses Ethereum as cryptocurrency entirely, while still relying on the backbone itself. 

Solana however, even with less stability is said to be poised for the mass. Since everything is running on the mainchain and uses Solana as the de-facto fuel, it is said to be a riskier bet, but with the potential of explosive growth. It's not made to be a stable asset (yet) tho. 

  
Ethereum is often compared to IBM (boring but stable) while Solana sits in-between being the next Sun Microsystems (huge for the time, but failed) or the next Google in the ...[truncated]","[SERIOUS] Ethereum vs Solana in 2026+ (technical and macroeconomic discussion)

The Stellar network is a decentralized blockchain built for financial products and services, combining smart contracts with a protocol designed for fast, low-cost payments. Institutions and developers worldwide issue assets and settle transactions on Stellar, which has processed billions of operations across millions of accounts.

Since smart contracts launched in early 2024, activity has expanded across DeFi and real-world assets. TVL across Stellar-based protocols has grown from about $16M in March 2024 to roughly $200M recently, based on public data. Institutions including PayPal, MasterCard, U.S. Bank, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Paxos, Ondo, Circle, and Etherfuse have expanded activity on Stellar. Payment access also continues to grow through MoneyGram’s global cash-to-USDC network, available in approximately 170+ countries.

This AMA will cover community questions about Stellar’s current state and how the ecosystem is evolving.

The next killer app will look obvious in hindsight as all great ideas do. Tokenizing future earnings may be one of those. Not because it is flashy or speculative, but because income smoothing creates real value, and modern financial systems still do a terrible job at providing it to the people who need it most. The idea sounds abstract until you sit down and dissect the underlying problem. A huge share of economic stress does not come from low lifetime earnings, but from volatile timing. For so many professions, money arrives in bursts. Bills do not. Living in that gap takes a toll. It changes how people think, how they sleep, and the kinds of decisions they feel forced to make. It breeds anxiety.

At a high level, tokenizing future earnings is an attempt to price and share that timing risk. Instead of forcing individuals to absorb all the volatility of their income stream, some of it gets distributed to outside capital in exchange for upfront stability. That trade already exists in primitive forms. Credit cards, payday loans, earned wage access, factoring, and revenue-based financing are all blunt instruments aimed at the same pain point. This isn’t a new desire. People have always wanted stability. Tokenization is just a more modern way to deliver it.

The first major hurdle is moral framing and public trust. Most people hear “future earnings” and immediately jump to a dystopian image of selling pieces of themselves. That reaction matters, because products that feel like identity-level claims invite backlash and regulation. The solution is structural, not rhetorical. Winning designs will avoid open-ended claims entirely. Contracts will be narrow, capped, time-bound, and tied to specific, legible income streams. The mental model needs to feel closer to a mortgage on a defined asset than a lien on a human life. Predatory loans have no place here. If it cannot be explained in one calm paragraph without sounding predatory, it will not survive contact with the real world.

The second hurdle is underwriting future income without recreating surveillance capitalism. Predicting earnings requires data, but the moment a system demands total financial visibility, it becomes invasive and brittle. A promising path is constraint rather than omniscience. Instead of underwriting “a person,” systems can underwrite observable cash flow channels: payroll providers, creator platforms, Stripe accounts, gig marketplaces. If income already passes through a trusted intermediary, the system does not need to know everything about the user, only whether the cash arrived. This mirrors how receivables financing works in small business, and it dramatically reduces both privacy risk and model complexity. It's tricky because underwriters demand the most amount of information possible to reduce risk and maximize profits but success necessitates as little friction as possible.

The third hurdle is enforcement and collections, which is where many well-intentioned financial products fail. Traditional debt relies on aggressive collection because it has to. A future-earnings model has to do the opposite. It has to default to mercy. That means automatic withholding when income is present, automatic pauses when income drops below a threshold, and no human-driven collections apparatus chasing people during hardship. Technically, this is a hard systems problem. On paper, you can juice returns by being ruthless. In reality, that’s how products blow up. The teams that win will accept slightly lower upside in exchange for systems that don’t collapse when life happens. Unfortunately you need to deal with people who will try to game the system and globalizing this effort presents challenges.

The fourth hurdle is regulatory classification. Is this credit? Is it an investment? Is it insurance? Earned wage access ran straight into this ambiguity, as did income sharing agreements. The lesson from those battles is that regulatory arbitrage is not a strategy. Products that try to be “not a loan” by clever wording tend to lose anyway. A more durable approach is to embrace consumer protections early with clear disclosures, caps on total repayment, standardized terms, and auditable rules. Tokenization can help here by making contracts transparent and tamper-resistant, but only if paired with clear legal recognition of what those contracts are.

The fifth hurdle is investor alignment. The moment upside becomes uncapped or time horizons become too long, incentives break. Investors start optimizing for extraction rather than stability. The fix is boring but essential. We need short durations, capped returns, and diversification by default. This shouldn’t be about striking it rich on someone else’s upside. It should be about steady, boring returns that come from smoothing out real income, not gambling on breakout succe ...[truncated]","Next Possible Breakout App Could Be

According to him, we’ve slowly traded decentralization for convenience. In his words, *“2026 is the year we take back lost ground in computing self-sovereignty”* a shift that goes beyond crypto and extends to everyday digital tools.

Buterin also acknowledged Ethereum’s past trade-offs. In the push for mass adoption, the ecosystem leaned toward convenience-first solutions (for example, “trust-me” wallets), partially sidelining its original decentralization ethos. His current focus is to reverse that trend and make **self-sovereign tools the default**.

Key building blocks already in motion include:

* **PeerDAS** (now live)
* **zkEVMs** (currently in alpha)
* **ERC-8004**, enabling agentic AI interactions on Ethereum

Together, these upgrades allow for **private, verifiable AI transactions**, micropayments, and decentralized compute positioning Ethereum as a backbone for AI agents that could challenge centralized players like Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic.

Digging deeper into the topic, I even came across projects like **Sentient**, recently listed on **Bitget**.  
The project raised $85M in seed funding, backed by Founders Fund (Peter Thiel), Pantera Capital, and Framework Ventures, and recently launched SERA, a next-generation crypto AI agent reportedly outperforming ChatGPT in tool-calling and real-time data access.

If Vitalik were to push a **fully Ethereum-native decentralized AI initiative**, likely more advanced than most current AI projects in the ecosystem, it could significantly accelerate adoption combining Ethereum’s scalability roadmap with genuine decentralization.

Personally, I see this as bullish long-term.

Centralized AI systems remain vulnerable to censorship, bias, and single points of control. Decentralized alternatives like Sentient could democratize AGI though **scalability and user experience** remain the main challenges.

**What do you think?**  
Could we realistically see a blockchain-based, decentralized AI rival Big Tech in the coming years?

Why 650 Million Africans are Quitting Banks,"Africa has some of the highest bank fees of any continent. According to former UN Deputy Secretary-General Vera Songwe, these fees range from $6 to $100. Meanwhile, transfers between accounts take between three days and a week.

These high fees, coupled with inadequate infrastructure, have forced 650 million people on the continent to abandon banking services altogether. While they may not have bank accounts, they do have smartphones and are aware of the advantages of stablecoin transfers.

Migrants, who traditionally send their earnings back to their homeland, were the first to conduct USDT transfers to Africa. Given the high inflation of African currencies, the digital dollar has also become an excellent means of saving.

USDT is most widely used in Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia and South Africa. The authorities in these countries have been trying unsuccessfully to combat the digital dollarisation of the local currency market. 

Meanwhile, Ghana is legalising crypto services, Nigeria is introducing tax reporting, and South African regulators are warning about the risks to system stability.

Currently, platforms such as Yellow Card, Luno and Quidax, which facilitate the purchase of stablecoins with fiat currencies, dominate the market.

The real issue is no longer *when* quantum computers become capable of breaking today’s cryptography, but whether decentralised blockchains can realistically migrate fast enough once the transition window opens.  
  
**Why the Quantum Threat Is Now Time-Sensitive**

Quantum computing progress is no longer purely speculative. Error-corrected systems continue to advance, and multiple analyses place the earliest realistic window for cryptographically relevant attacks in the late 2020s.

At the same time, global cryptographic standards bodies have already begun publishing formal deprecation timelines for classical public-key algorithms such as RSA and ECDSA due to their known vulnerability to future quantum attacks.

This creates a critical overlap.

The deadline to migrate away from vulnerable cryptography may arrive before large-scale quantum attack capability becomes publicly visible.  
  
**Why Decentralised Blockchains Face a Structural Constraint**

In traditional IT environments, cryptographic upgrades are difficult but manageable.

They rely on centralised authority, known participants, and coordinated rollout schedules.

Blockchains operate under very different assumptions.

A cryptographic migration in a decentralised system requires global coordination across nodes, miners or validators, wallets, exchanges, custodians, and end users. It also requires years of development, peer review, audits, testing, and deployment.

Every participant must migrate keys correctly. Any participant who fails to do so remains permanently vulnerable.

Estimates for a safe, system-wide post-quantum migration of a large blockchain commonly fall in the range of five to ten years, even under optimistic assumptions.

That is a long timeframe in an environment where an attacker only needs to succeed once.  
  
**The Hard Fork Reality**

Changing a blockchain’s signature scheme is not a cosmetic upgrade.

It fundamentally alters transaction validation rules, wallet compatibility, and long-standing assumptions about ownership and security.

A post-quantum hard fork would almost certainly introduce chain splits, fragmented liquidity, and uncertainty over which chain retains economic and social legitimacy.

There is no guarantee that a quantum-safe fork automatically inherits the trust, adoption, or value of the original network.  
  
**Why Quantum Attacks Are Especially Difficult to Detect**

One of the most concerning aspects is detectability.

A quantum attacker does not need to disrupt consensus or exploit a software bug. They can derive a private key from a public key, generate a mathematically valid signature, and submit a normal transaction.

From the network’s perspective, everything appears correct.  
The signature verifies.  
The transaction is valid.  
No alarms are triggered.

It does not look like an attack.  
It looks like the legitimate owner moved their funds.

By the time anomalous patterns are noticed, the damage has already occurred.  
  
**Asymmetric Timelines and State-Level Capabilities**

Public quantum timelines are based on commercial roadmaps and academic disclosures.

However, cryptographic agencies have repeatedly warned that state-level capabilities may advance ahead of publicly acknowledged benchmarks, particularly in strategic areas such as cryptanalysis.

This does not imply that attacks are imminent.

It does imply that defenders face uncertainty, while attackers do not need to announce readiness.

In that environment, delayed migration becomes a structural vulnerability rather than a theoretical concern.  
  
**The Core Question Going Forward**

The discussion should not be framed as “Will quantum computers break crypto tomorrow?”

A more relevant question is “Which systems can realistically survive a rapid shift in cryptographic assumptions?”

That is ultimately a governance, coordination, and architecture problem, not just a cryptography problem.

As quantum timelines compress, blockchains that depend on mass, synchronous upgrades may find themselves racing a clock they do not fully control.

Curious to hear how others here think about this risk, particularly from a protocol design or governance perspective.

If you look closely at the image above, you are not just looking at a tech stack, you are looking at the emerging backbone of onchain finance.

Some crypto projects just specialize in one thing, some do data feeds, other focus on cross chain interoperability, others tackle privacy, compliance or institutional workflows and that is fine but that is not how global finance works.

Real financial systems need all of it, working together, securely and at scale. This is what Chainlink has been quietly building.

The Chainlink Stack shows a full spectrum approach as you can see in the image above:

* **Onchain Data Protocol (ODP)** for reliable market data, proof of reserves, NAVs and real-world inputs.
* **CCIP** for secure cross-chain messaging and token transfers, not bridges but infrastructure-grade interoperability.
* **Compliance and Privacy Standards** that institutions actually require.
* **Runtime Environment (CRE)** to integrate blockchains with existing systems, workflows and tooling.

Now if you zoom out you have DeFi protocols like Aave, Lido, GMX. TradFi giants like Swift, JPMorgan, UBS, ANZ, Euroclear, Mastercard and thousands of public and private blockchains underneath it all.

Chainlink is not trying to replace blockchains, it is doing something more important, making blockchains usable for the real world.

  
Chainlink is positioning itself as the standard layer everything else plugs into.

Ethereum does not fit neatly into either bucket.

A more accurate post-Merge description is: **no fixed terminal cap, but an issuance model that allows an upper bound on supply growth over any chosen time window, under stated assumptions.**

The goal here is not to relabel ETH as ""capped"". It is to tighten the language so people can argue about the same object.

---

## Definitions

A lot of confusion comes from using ""capped"" to mean different things: total supply at time T, the annualized issuance rate, or net issuance after burn.

---

## What changed after the Merge (and why it matters)

Since the Merge, Ethereum's block production and consensus rewards are governed by proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain specs, not proof-of-work mining economics. In PoS, issuance follows protocol reward formulas and is tied to staking participation rather than hashpower competition.

That makes Ethereum's baseline issuance path rule-based rather than what you see with fiat or centralized currencies, where it is discretionary on a per-period basis.

---

## ""Issuance cannot go to literal zero"" — the security-budget tradeoff

A common intuition is that if a network wants non-zero security, it needs an ongoing payment stream to validators, which may imply ongoing issuance if fees alone are not expected to cover it. In practice, Ethereum validator revenue can include issuance, transaction tips/priority fees, and MEV (maximal extractable value). The base fee is burned rather than paid to validators.

Ethereum trades the simplicity of a supply hard-cap for the security of an incentive design that can keep validator participation viable across different fee/usage patterns.

---

## A ""finite supply on any finite timeline""

Even without a hard cap, it is possible to \*\*bound the maximum supply increase over a specified interval\*\* by choosing conservative (worst-case) assumptions, such as:

* assume minimal burn (including the conservative bound burn = 0), and

* assume maximal issuance consistent with the staking-dependent issuance formula.

Under these assumptions, an **upper bound** for supply at time T can be computed for Ethereum: not a guaranteed endpoint, but a ceiling.

This ceiling is often calculated at approximately **1.51% annualized gross issuance**^1 . This figure represents a theoretical maximum inflation rate that assumes 100% of all ETH is staked and zero fees are burned — a scenario that functions as a ""worst-case"" bound for dilution.

This can be characterized as a supply cap that adjusts upward at a slow and predetermined rate. The ""cap"" is not a fixed terminal number, but a deterministic upper-bound curve that rises over time under the protocol's rules.

Soon, the crypto and stock markets could face a massive correction.",69,0.75,94,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qlg25q/mike_mcglone_urges_selling_bitcoin_as_gold_surges/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qlg25q/mike_mcglone_urges_selling_bitcoin_as_gold_surges/,negative,"Criticizes Bitcoin, urges selling, negative outlook."

""Here are some of the things you don't want to hear 👇

# 1. There will be no alt season.

This doesn't feel like a hot take to me, but I'm sure this will rub people the wrong way. It's also a fairly obvious conclusion because if you look at any other alt season, the circumstances are no longer the same.

Back when we had those incredible rips where every token went up, people were actually interested in crypto, shocking I know.

But crypto was this underground thing that normies thought they could get rich on. Don't underestimate how powerful of a feeling that is for regular people! Many work a dead-end 9-to-5, and crypto was their perceived escape.

Unfortunately for them and us, that is no longer the case. When memecoins gained prominence, normies tried to gamble their way to riches... and you can guess how that turned out for most.

And the majority of them never even touched the best parts of our space! They didn't use blue-chip DeFi or own Bitcoin, and probably very little of them actually owned ETH.

I'd say they didn't touch DeFi in general, but I remember many a TikTok around  [$TIME](https://x.com/search?q=%24TIME&src=cashtag_click) and Wonderland. If you know, you know.

So knowing that normies got burned on crypto, why would they want to come back? A lot of my friends who entered crypto because of me left (pain), and that was because they couldn't stomach the volatility. It takes a certain amount of mental illness to go through the peaks and valleys that crypto people deal with.

Another big difference is that they no longer have disposable income. When the govt was dropping stimmies left and right, people were like, fuck it, let's see what we can turn this into.

Plus, this was around the same time as the Gamestop fuckery where everyone was buying penny stocks and trying to be the next RoaringKitty.

Crypto was just the next logical destination for that ball of hot, flaming money.

Do we see any of that happening right now? Why would retail come back to crypto, which previously bent them over like a gang member in prison, when they could just speculate on stocks?

I know we're all tired of hearing this argument, but when you look at AI, Drones, Rare Materials/Metals, and Robotics, normies can find multiples in a way safer environment.

I don't think it is a coincidence that we're underperforming stocks so hard, or that BTC is underperforming metals so hard.

Trust in crypto assets to outperform is at incredibly low levels, even among true believers.

And I think there's a reason for that as well.""

In previous [Lessons](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qeo0bq/what_is_cryptocurrency_after_all_the_bitcoin/), we explored **Public Blockchains** like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are open networks where anyone can participate, and every transaction is transparent to the world.

However, for some global industries, this is a dealbreaker. 

A bank or a logistics company wants the security of a blockchain, but they cannot share their internal data with the public or their competitors.

This led to the creation of **Private Chains**, also known as **Permissioned Blockchains**.

# The Problem: Public vs. Private

If a Public Blockchain (like Ethereum) is a ""Public Mall"" that anyone can walk into, a Private Chain is a ""Members-Only Warehouse.""

Corporations faced a dilemma:

1. **They wanted the tech:** Instant settlements and immutable records.
2. **They couldn't use the open networks:** They have legal requirements to know exactly who they are dealing with (Compliance) and must keep trade secrets hidden (Privacy).

# The Solution: Permissioned Access

To solve this, developers created blockchains where access is restricted.

* **Public (Permissionless):** Anyone can join, download the ledger, and validate transactions. (e.g., Bitcoin).
* **Private (Permissioned):** You usually need an invitation to join. The network is controlled by a specific organization or a group of companies (a Consortium).

**How it Works**

In a private chain, the ""Miners"" are not anonymous users solving math puzzles. They are known entities: usually the IT departments of the companies involved.

Because all the participants are identified and legally bound to each other, the network doesn't need energy-intensive security. 

If 10 out of 15 member banks agree on a transaction, it is approved. This makes these chains incredibly fast and cheap to run.

# Real World Use Cases

These chains don't usually have ""coins"" for the public to buy, but they are a massive part of the blockchain industry.

**1. Supply Chain Tracking**

Companies can use private ledgers to track goods between trusted partners.

* *Example:* A car manufacturer, a shipping company, and a parts supplier share a private blockchain. They can track a shipment of engines in real-time. If an engine arrives damaged, the immutable ledger proves exactly when and where the damage occurred, without exposing this data to the public.

**2. Banking Settlements**

Banks utilize private chains to settle debts between each other instantly, replacing slow legacy systems that take days to clear funds.

# Criticism

Some crypto purists argue that Private Chains are not ""true crypto"" because they are centralized. They view them as simply ""shared databases.""

However, for the enterprise world, they offer a middle ground: using the efficiency of blockchain technology without the risks of an open network.

# Categorizing all CryptoAssets

Now that we have covered the history, public chains, tokens, and private chains, we now go onto finalizing this course. 

With thousands of assets on the market, how do we distinguish a currency from a tech platform or a meme?

It is time to organize the chaos.

After a year that's hundreds of dollars going to a middleman. So I built my own system. Here's the breakdown for anyone curious.

**The problem with existing platforms:**

* Monthly fees ($15-50/mo) just to use their software
* Transaction fees on top (5-10% per sale)
* They hold your payments before releasing to you
* Your subscriber data lives on their servers
* If they shut down, your whole system breaks
* Stripe/PayPal chargebacks are constant headaches
* Limited control over referral programs

**What I built instead:**

Payments go directly to my own crypto wallet. Not through a platform, not held by anyone else. Mine. I use USDC on Arbitrum so transaction fees are around $0.01 per payment instead of percentage-based.

**Features:**

* Auto-adds subscribers to private channels when they pay
* Auto-removes them when subscription expires
* Sends renewal reminders before expiry
* Works with multiple private channels (one subscription = access to several channels)
* Hub → Client posting system (I post in a ""hub"" channel, bot forwards to subscriber channels - keeps my identity hidden)
* Full subscriber database that I own and can export

**The referral system (this was the game changer):**

Every subscriber gets their own referral link. When their friends sign up, both people get bonus subscription time. I control the rewards:

* Different bonuses for different plans (3-month plan = +1 month each, yearly = +2 months each)
* Can change bonus amounts anytime through admin panel
* Tracks every referral chain - I see exactly who's bringing in subscribers
* Users can check their own stats (total referrals, months earned)
* Rewards apply automatically

With InviteMember you get their preset options or nothing. Here I make the rules.

**Costs now vs before:**

Before: \~$30/month platform + 5-10% per sale  
Now: \~$6/month server + $0.01 per transaction

Been running it for a while and it's been solid. I've had a few people ask if I'd set one up for them. If anyone's running paid channels and wants something like this, I'm open to setting it up for a one-time fee. Comment or message if you want details.

Some notes on what is happening,"So now Quantum resistance is going mainstream.  Coinbase just announced an advisory board for risk mitigation.  Vitalik has announced it as a top priority.  And everyone is trying to land messaging around it.

Things to know

First the usual- yes, this affects all systems and not just crypto.    
  
Everyone will need solutions.  And that's why we are seeing governments and businesses (like Coinbase, Apple, Google) all start to work on it.

The unique challenge in crypto- you need consensus across a decentralized system.  And if it has user impacts, you have to be very careful so they can navigate the change (with time to do so.

For BTC, people are realizing that it is best to deal with this.  There is perceived risk, which equals market risk.  It is a tough change with much disagreement on the approach due to various impacts on the required change.   

As mentioned, ETH is focused on it, but faces all the same challenges.

Going down the tagged list

ZEC is a new addition.  Their shielded transactions offer protection, but if you want to use the public side, that is still vulnerable.  They will need to fix this to be considered quantum resistant

STRK is a layer 2 scaling solution for eth.  Since the root issue is your digital signature and protecting your wallet, it will be dependent on the Ethereum solution

Nervos is Cell based architecture.  I don't have the depth here, but I read ""The *protocol enables* quantum resistance, but users must choose to adopt quantum-secure lock scripts or wallets like Quantum Purse""

QANX (I hold this one) is pre-mainnet and has focused on a seamless transition of digital signatures.  This innovation has use cases being implemented at Ueno bank through their Itti partnership alongside SignQuantum.  They will need public mainnet to realize the benefit of this solution.  In general, they have a heavy focus in enterprise utility.

Naoris was fairly new to the list.  They promote that they can secure networks as a layer 0.  Like nervos, this is beyond my depth.  Already wild leveraged trading if you like that.  Not for me

And the list goes on.  There will continue to be many storylines here.    
  
My personal take is among major chains, we may see some gain/lose ground based on how this plays out, but hopefully it won't be as big of impact as some projects would like to hope.

It will certainly create visibility for well positioned projects.","Projects racing to add Quantum Resistant tag. Some notes on what is happening

But in my opinion, we are completely ignoring the actual bottleneck.

We have solved the easy part: you can tokenize a building on Ethereum in 30 seconds.

But it still takes **18 months** to get the permit to actually *build* that building.

The blockchain part is fast. The ""Real World"" part is agonizingly slow. If we want crypto to actually upgrade the economy, we cannot just tokenize the *asset*; we have to tokenize the *bureaucracy* that governs it.

There is a concept I call the **""Green Lane""** — a way to use zero-knowledge proofs to bypass the government bottleneck entirely.

---

## The Problem: We are bottlenecked by ""Meatspace""

Right now, we freeze billions of dollars in construction capital because we rely on a 19th-century technology: humans reading paper.

**The Manual Lane (current state)**  
- **Mechanism:** Human interpretation, committees, paper filing  
- **Time to permit:** 6–18 months  
- **Trust assumption:** ""Trust the bureaucrat"".

**The Green Lane (the crypto solution)**  
- **Mechanism:** ZK-proven compliance, machine-verified codes, smart contract enforcement  
- **Time to permit:** ~24 hours  
- **Trust assumption:** ""Trust the code"".

This is not about cutting regulations. It is about changing *who* enforces them.

---

## The Core Concept: Law as a Circuit

Today, an architect sends blueprints to a city planner. That planner interprets the rules subjectively. This process is slow, error-prone, and bribable.

The Green Lane proposes a shift: **if a design can *prove* it satisfies the building code mathematically, no human interpretation is required.**

We do not need a city official to eyeball whether a hallway is six feet wide. We need a ZK-proof that the constraint `hallway_width >= 6.0` is satisfied.

---

## The Privacy Paradox (Why we need ZK, not just PDFs)

This is where the crypto tech stack becomes essential.

- **Cities** need to see the plans to ensure safety  
- **Architects** hide plans because blueprints are valuable IP  

This stalemate creates the delay. ZK-SNARKs resolve it cleanly:

1. The architect runs a proof locally  
2. The city receives a cryptographic receipt saying ""This design complies with safety standards"".  
3. **Result:** the city never sees the IP, but knows the building is safe.

---

## Why Ethereum? (The neutral verifier)

This is why I believe this has to happen on a credible public chain like Ethereum.

For a ""Green Lane"" to work, the verifier cannot be a centralized server owned by the city. If the government controls the server, it can simply pause it whenever it wants to stifle development. You have recreated the old system with a different database.

The verifier must be **neutral, unstoppable, and non-corruptible**.  
It must be a **smart contract**.

Ethereum is currently the only ecosystem with the maturity to run a verifier that:

1. Enforces the law exactly as written  
2. Cannot be bribed  
3. Cannot be turned off by a new mayor  

---

## The End State

Markets route around friction.

If **Path A** requires 12 months of lobbying and holding costs,  
and **Path B** requires 24 hours of computation and a ZK proof,

capital will flow to Path B.

We often talk about ""flippenings"" in terms of market cap. The real flippening is when we move from a world where we ask for **permission** (subjective) to a world where we offer **proof** (objective).

I'd genuinely love for you legends to stress-test this little beast:

* Send yourselves some nano
* Try weird amounts (dust, max, decimals)
* Refresh a ton, open multiple tabs
* Switch networks / VPN / mobile/desktop
* Try to break the form, spam it, do silly stuff

If you spot anything funky — bugs, weird UI behavior, transaction failures, balance not updating, security red flags, XSS potential, rate-limit bypasses, anything at all — please screenshot + describe and drop it here or DM me. Vulnerability reports are especially welcome (and will be massively appreciated).

No pressure, but every test + every snarky bug report helps make it less embarrassing before I show it to more people 😅

https://preview.redd.it/096fip3ngzeg1.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af33a5c612337fff915bb212b39caf83237a310

One of the biggest criticisms of some cryptocurrencies is that they can be slow and expensive. If you try to use a major blockchain during busy periods, fees can skyrocket, making small purchases difficult.

If crypto is to handle global finance - buying coffee, trading stocks, and running apps - it needs to process millions of transactions per second.

One of the industry’s solution to this is a technology called **Layer 2**.

# The Problem: The Blockchain Trilemma

To understand why blockchains can be slow, one must understand the **Blockchain Trilemma**. In computer science, some people believe a blockchain can only prioritize two of the following three features:

1. **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the network.
2. **Security:** The network is immutable and resistant to attacks.
3. **Scalability (Speed):** The network can handle massive transaction volume cheaply.

https://preview.redd.it/eu3fh19ljzeg1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4980c9642059d26b0f4850798131c066d41ee1fd

Major blockchains (Layer 1) prioritized **Decentralization** and **Security**.

They are designed to be secure digital vaults. To achieve this, every node in the network verifies every transaction.

This makes them secure, but inherently slow.

# One Solution: Layer 2

Developers realized that trying to make the main blockchain faster often compromised security.

Instead, they decided to stop processing every single transaction on the main chain.

They built a secondary framework **on top** of the main blockchain.

* **Layer 1 (The Settlement Layer):** This is the main blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). Its only job is to be the ultimate source of truth and security.
* **Layer 2 (The Execution Layer):** This is where some transactions can happen. It is designed for speed and low cost.

# How it Works: The ""Bar Tab"" Model

The simplest way to understand the relationship between Layer 1 and Layer 2 is the concept of a **Bar Tab**.

* **Layer 1 Transaction:** Paying for every single drink individually with a credit or gift card  is slow and incurs a transaction fee every time.
* **Layer 2 Transaction:** Opening a tab. The bartender records your drinks on a notepad. You get your drinks instantly, and there is no bank transaction fee for each order.
* **Settlement:** At the end of the night, you pay the **total** sum once on the main register.

Some Layer 2 networks work similarly. They process thousands of transactions externally, then bundle them up and submit a single proof to the main blockchain to be ""settled.""

# Rollups: Bundling for Efficiency

One of the primary technologies used is called a **Rollup**.

A Rollup ""rolls up"" thousands of individual transfers into a single packet of data. The Layer 2 network executes these transactions and simply posts the final result to Layer 1.

Because the expensive transaction fee on Layer 1 is split among thousands of users in the bundle, the individual cost for each user becomes fractions of a penny.

# The Trade-off

If Layer 2 is faster, why do we need Layer 1?

Layer 1 remains the anchor. It provides the security and the final settlement.

Layer 2 networks are faster but rely on Layer 1 to finalize their data. If the Layer 1 blockchain disappeared, the Layer 2 network would lose its security guarantee.

For the end user, this means you can enjoy the speed of a modern app with the security of a decentralized blockchain running in the background.

# Layers and Layers

You can build Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer n basically.

An example of Layer 3 would be a bar tab being divided further between many people. And then you can build a credit and debt system for people sharing the tab. And so on.

Some people believe that Layer 1 can eventually be optimized for anything, making Layer 2s unnecessary. However, as of this day and age, Layer 2s remain an important historical aspect of crypto, worth learning about on this Educational Series.

# Summary

* **Layer 1** is the **Main Blockchain**, usually used for Settlement. It can be slow, expensive, and hyper-secure.
* **Layer 2** is anything **built on top** of the Main Blockchain. It can be faster, cheaper, and may handle more volume.
* **Rollups** bundle thousands of transactions and settle them as one.
* **Layer Scaling** means using Layers to improve blockchains like with Rollups or using other methods.
* There are, of course, many other ways to scale blockchains, including just improving Layer 1 cryptos.

Payments are slow across borders, expensive for small transactions, tied to banking hours, and often gated by who you are or where you live. For millions of people, access is limited or unreliable. Crypto matters because it removes those constraints. It lets value move globally, instantly, and without permission. But that promise only matters if it works in normal, everyday situations. If crypto cannot handle buying coffee, groceries, or paying a bill without friction, it will never be more than a niche tool.

This is where most blockchains fail today. People may be interested in using crypto day to day, but the moment you imagine actually doing it, the problems begin to show up. Everything from fees jumping when a network gets too busy to a simple purchase taking too long to confirm, or even transactions failing altogether. In systems with centralized components, there is always the fear that the network might be down right when you need it. At a checkout counter, none of that is acceptable. Money has to be predictable, fast, and dependable, or people will simply default back to what already works.

This is why Monad feels relevant to the everyday payments conversation. For daily use, fees have to stay low and boring all the time, not just during quiet periods. No one wants to think about network congestion when buying lunch or concert tickets as the timer continues to tic. Monad is built to handle high throughput so demand does not immediately translate into higher costs. That ability to absorb real usage without punishing users is foundational if crypto is ever going to function like money instead of a premium novelty.

Speed matters just as much. In real life, slow payments are failed payments. People are not going to wait while a transaction processes, and merchants are not going to design their businesses around uncertainty. Heck, we get bent out of shape if the credit card doesn't go through within 5 seconds. Monad’s fast execution and quick confirmations are not about bragging rights, they are about making payments instant enough that no one has to think about them. The more invisible the process feels, the more natural it becomes to use.

Reliability is the last piece, and it’s where decentralization really matters. People trust money because it works when they need it, not just when conditions are perfect. Single points of failure break that trust immediately, which is why concerns around centralized sequencers are valid. Monad is decentralized and becoming more so over time, with a clear path toward greater resilience and reduced reliance on any one component. Instead of ignoring the problem, Monad is actively designed to remove failure points as it evolves. That direction matters, because a global payment system has to keep working on ordinary days and stressful ones alike, without obvious ways to go offline.

Even with strong infrastructure, adoption lives or dies on onboarding. Most people do not want to learn how blockchains work. They do not want to manage keys, think about gas, or understand network states. They want an app that feels familiar. Download it and fund it easily. Wallets need to hide complexity, use stable assets by default, and offer protections like recovery and perhaps even have spending limits as this is what people currently expect. When crypto feels as safe and simple as existing payment apps, people stop treating it as something separate.

This is how crypto becomes an everyday player globally. In many parts of the world, mobile payments are already normal. Crypto does not need to replace those systems overnight. It needs to plug in quietly, offering instant settlement, low costs, and open access without adding friction. When onboarding is simple and payments are fast, reliable, and predictable, adoption does not require belief or education. It happens naturally.

That is what makes Monad compelling. It focuses on the fundamentals people actually care about when money is involved. Low fees, speed, reliability, and simplicity. Not hype, not theory, just whether it works under pressure in boring, real world moments. If those pieces come together, crypto does not need to argue its case. It just becomes something people use, everywhere, without thinking twice.

In his view, crypto developers haven't yet proven their products' resilience against potential crypto wallet key hacks. He cited statistics that the advent of robust quantum computing threatens a potential attack on half of all coins in circulation.

The banker's opinion is shared by Ray Dalio, BlackRock, and Jefferies strategist Christopher Wood. Wood recently removed Bitcoin from his long-term retirement portfolio, stating the ""store of value"" concept had become less reliable.

However, according to venture investor Nic Carter, institutional investors prefer to downplay the quantum threat. Billions have flowed into the industry, and no one wants to start a panic.

But it seems Coinbase has gone against the institutional players' strategy of keeping quiet. The crypto exchange is creating an independent advisory council on quantum computing and blockchain. 

Although, there's likely more marketing than education in this move. Coinbase wants to show it's ready to become the sole platform capable of protecting crypto investors with its long-term post-quantum strategy.

 They posted a seemingly harmless generic question like:

* ""How do you swap ETH to XMR?""
* ""How do you trade BTC with no KYC?""
* ""How do you restore wallet with seed phrase?""

The body text usually uses short **AI slop** like:

>""I’m trying to swap some ETH to XMR and want to understand the best way people usually do this. I found **mysite.scam** which looks trustworthy, anyone else tried using it?""

When posting, the scammer will plant some comments with his alts which will later be edited to endorse the scams too.

>I'm using mysite.scam all the time! It's 100% safe!

Those comments will be upvote-botted so it's at the top of the thread.

# Who's the Victim?

They're hoping people who search that question in Google would land on the thread and used the scam sites.

Also, LLM like ChatGPT might possibly use the thread as reference in answering question.

In our last [Lesson](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qia3c3/the_world_computer_ethereum_and_other/), we discussed the ""World Computer"", Ethereum, and other Smart Contract Protocols. We learned that while Bitcoin acts like a pure currency, Ethereum is also a World Computer that runs any software in a decentralized way.

Today, we explore the most famous result of that innovation: **Tokens.**

Tokens are a type of CryptoAssets.

# The Shopping Mall Analogy

To understand tokens, imagine a giant **Shopping Mall**.

1. **The Mall (The Blockchain):** This is the infrastructure. It provides security, electricity, and the rules of operation. Like Ethereum, or other Protocols.
2. **Cash (The Native Coin):** To enter the mall or pay for general maintenance, you use the mall’s official currency (like Ether).
3. **Gift Cards (The Tokens):** Inside the mall, specific shops can issue their own cards.

A ""Coffee Shop Card"" is redeemable only at the coffee shop. You cannot use it to pay the mall’s electricity bill, but within that shop, it is money.

You can also trade and sell Gift Cards on the open market, making them usable as currency sometimes.

This is how Tokens work. They do not have their own blockchain.

They are ""guest assets"" that live inside an existing blockchain (like Ethereum). They piggyback on the World Computer's security so they don't have to build their own.

# Why Create a Token?

Before smart contracts, if you wanted to create a CryptoAsset, you had to build a ""Mall"" (Blockchain) from scratch. You needed servers, miners, and code. It was expensive and difficult.

With the World Computer, you can simply write a few lines of code to create a ""Gift Card"" (Token).

To make this efficient, developers agreed on a standard ""Card Shape"" (technically called ERC-20, while others also exist). Because all these tokens have the exact same technical ""shape"", they all fit into the same wallets and can be traded on the same exchanges automatically. This standardization caused an explosion of new digital assets.

# Types of Tokens

Not all tokens are trying to be money (simple Gift Cards), though almost all tokens can be freely traded on the open market.

In the smart economy, tokens usually fall into three categories:

**1. Utility Tokens (The Arcade Ticket)**: These act like tickets to access a specific service or product.

* *Example:* Imagine a cloud storage service built on the blockchain. To save a file, you must pay with their specific token. If you don't own the token, you can't use the software.

**2. Governance Tokens (The Ballot):** These act like voting slips.

* *Example:* A new kind of Company emerged called Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where Token holders have the power to vote.

**3. Asset-Backed Tokens (The I.O.U.):** Real World Assets (RWA) Tokenization is the process of representing something valuable in the real world with a Token on the Blockchain.

* *Example:*  A company buys a house for $1 Million US Dollars and ""tokenizes"" it, by creating 1 million tokens and selling them for 1.1 USD each. Each token represents a part-ownership in that house. The company can make a profit, and people can now own houses (or any other assets) in a decentralized way.

# Summary

* A lot of CryptoAssets have their own blockchain (Layer 1).
* **Tokens:** Live on top of another blockchain. They might be the currency of a specific application, or any other type of Token.

Tokens transformed crypto from a simple payment system into a complex economy of apps, voting systems, and digital assets.

**But as thousands of tokens filled the mall, the hallways became crowded**.

In the next lesson, we will explain **Scaling**: what happens when the World Computer gets too crowded, and how ""Layer 2"" solutions are trying to fix it.

See you in **Lesson 7**.

Welcome back to r/CryptoCurrency Academy. In our last [Lesson](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qia3c3/the_world_computer_ethereum_and_other/), we discussed the ""World Computer"", Ethereum, and other Smart Contract Protocols. We learned that while Bitcoin acts like a pure currency, Ethereum is also a World Computer that runs any software in a decentralized way.

Today, we explore the most famous result of that innovation: **Tokens.**

Tokens are a type of CryptoAssets.

# The Shopping Mall Analogy

To understand tokens, imagine a giant **Shopping Mall**.

1. **The Mall (The Blockchain):** This is the infrastructure. It provides security, electricity, and the rules of operation. Like Ethereum, or other Protocols.
2. **Cash (The Native Coin):** To enter the mall or pay for general maintenance, you use the mall’s official currency (like Ether).
3. **Gift Cards (The Tokens):** Inside the mall, specific shops can issue their own cards.

A ""Coffee Shop Card"" is redeemable only at the coffee shop. You cannot use it to pay the mall’s electricity bill, but within that shop, it is money.

* Bitcoin was the most-used payment asset, accounting for 22.1% of all on-chain payments
* Litecoin remained the third most-used crypto, increasing its share from 13.1% to 14.4%
* Ethereum-network payments increased from 11.2% to 15.1%, supported by increased ETH and USDC usage
* Layer 2 payment activity increased, with Polygon up 19% and Arbitrum up 21% year over year
* Average cart size was €108, with crypto mainly used for digital services, software, and subscriptions
* Payment activity remained global, with usage across North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa
* More merchants kept the crypto they received instead of converting to fiat, with crypto settlements rising from 27% to 37.5%

Personally, I’m not fully convinced that it would work out that cleanly. Even if a conversion did happen, I doubt people would receive the full equivalent value of what they originally had. Historically, when currencies are replaced or restructured, everyday holders often end up taking a haircut, whether through unfavorable conversion rates, inflation, caps, or policy decisions. It seems more likely that people would get a fraction of the real purchasing power they once had—essentially peanuts compared to what their fiat was worth before. I’m curious how others see this playing out and whether they think waiting truly carries no risk.

Welcome to **Course 2**.

In [Course 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qeo0bq/what_is_cryptocurrency_after_all_the_bitcoin/), we covered the history of money, the birth of Bitcoin, and the concept of CryptoCurrency. We learned that Bitcoin is Digital Money: a secure, decentralized way to store and send value.

But what if we could apply that to everything?

Decentralized internet, messaging, software, data, ownership, governance.

# Currency vs. Asset: What is the difference?

To understand the crypto market, you must understand this distinction:

* A **Currency** (like Bitcoin) is a **Medium of Exchange** or a **Storage of Value**. Its primary job is to pay for goods or store wealth, like a a dollar bill or gold.
* An **Asset** is a **Resource**. Anything that you own, use, or borrow, can be an asset. It can be a commodity you consume, an investment, or even a Currency.

All currency can be an Asset. But not all Assets are simply a currency.

# The World Computer

What if we applied BTC's decentralization to everything?

That is the question that Vitalik Buterin asked himself before he created Ethereum.

If Bitcoin is a ledger of *transactions*, Ethereum is a ledger of *everything*.

Developers can upload any code to the Ethereum blockchain. This code lives on thousands of computers (nodes) simultaneously. When you interact with the code, every node in the network runs it to verify the result.

This turns the network into one giant, decentralized computer known as the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**. It is a computer that no single person owns, and no government can turn off.

# Smart Contracts

The programs running on this computer are called **Smart Contracts**.

A Smart Contract can be anything.

For example, the simplest Smart Contracts are like a digital vending machine. They hold funds and only releases them when specific conditions are met. This allows us to build agreements that execute themselves without a bank, attorney, or any intermediary in the middle.

**Real-World Example: The ""Trustless"" Vending Machine:**

Imagine you want to buy a piece of software like a game or an app.

* **The Old Way:** You need a lot of intermediaries.
* **The Smart Contract Way:** You write a program on Ethereum that says:
   * *If* the user sends 1 ETH -> Send software to user.

Once this code is deployed, nobody can stop it or change it, except if the person who wrote it allows.

Users know that if they send money, they get the product.

Sellers know that the money is received and will be stored in his wallet safely without trusting any other third parties.

# How does it work?

Running this code costs electricity. If running programs on the World Computer were free, someone could write a loop that runs forever and crash the system.

To prevent this, the network usually charges a fee for every step of computation. This fee is called **Gas** (on Ethereum).

You pay Gas using the network's native asset, **Ether (ETH)**. This is why ETH is a **Utility Asset**: it is the **digital fuel** required to run the engine of the World Computer.

That being said, ETH can also be seen as a Currency as it can be used as a medium of exchange or storage of value. It really depends on how you use it.

# Summary

* **Bitcoin** is a **Pure Currency**: Digital Gold. It tracks ownership. May store value.
* **Ethereum** is a **Protocol** or **Platform**: The World Computer. It runs code.
* **Ether (ETH)** is an **Asset**: Digital Oil. It fuels the computer.

**In addition, several other Protocols appeared after Ethereum.**

Some protocols claim to be faster, cheaper, or more secure than Ethereum.

However, Ethereum remains the most used and biggest major Protocol CryptoAsset, while also being the first.

Since this is an Educational Series, we will refrain from citing examples that aren't historical.

# Next Lesson

Now that we know crypto can be more than just money, we need to organize the chaos.

There are millions of cryptos out there: what do they all do?

**Next Up:** What are Tokens? Layer 2? All that and other types of CryptoAssets will be classified soon on this Educational Series.

My reaction? “Oh. Another Tuesday.”  
And that scared me more than the number itself.

Back in October, that $19B liquidation day when BTC nuked from $126k felt apocalyptic. People were genuinely shaken. Now we see $300–500M liquidation events almost weekly and the timeline just… moves on.

Here's what bothers me: I've been liquidated twice this year. Not because my thesis was wrong or I overleveraged like an idiot. Both times, the exchange went ""under maintenance"" during the dump.

First time: Binance, March. BTC drops 12% in 8 minutes. I try to close my position → ""Error: system overload."" Try mobile app → same thing. Try to add margin → ""Deposits temporarily disabled."" Position liquidated at literally the worst tick. 23 minutes later, everything works fine.

Second time: Different CEX, similar story. Price crashes, platform freezes, liquidation goes through, platform unfreezes. $4.7k gone.

I'm not even mad anymore. I'm just numb to it. And that's the problem.

We've all collectively decided that:  
Exchanges going down during volatility = normal  
$500M erased in a few hours = just another day  
Getting liquidated due to ""technical issues"" = part of the game

When did this become acceptable?

I've been looking at non-custodial perps (Phantom, Trust Wallet, etc.) because at least if I get rekt, it's my own fault and not because some server conveniently crashed. Found Atomic Wallet's version lets you deposit via TRX-USDT – $0.50 fees instead of $15 on Ethereum. Small thing, but when you're paranoid about leaving funds on CEXs, it matters.

But here's my actual question:  
If you've been liquidated multiple times this year, why are you still trading perps?

I'm genuinely asking. Not judging, I'm still here too, somehow. But what's the thesis? Are we making money long-term, or just paying for the dopamine hit of 10x leverage while pretending it's ""strategy""?

Because from where I'm sitting, perps feel less like trading and more like betting against:  
Liquidation cascades you can't predict  
Stop-loss hunting algorithms  
Exchange outages that always happen during dumps (funny how that works)

Be honest with yourself: if leverage trading disappeared tomorrow, would you miss the strategy – or just the rush?

I don't have the answer. Maybe I'm being dramatic. Maybe this is just what trading looks like now and I need to adapt or leave.

I'm curious to learn how crypto would likely react *if* this scenario happens. 

**Context**: Given recent political events in the US, there is spreading opinion that the international community is moving away from the US Dollar (USD) as its main reserve currency. The USD has long been the backbone of international trade, investment, and reserves: Countries buy USD and US debt; nations and corporations trade oil in USD; as we all know, international crypto prices are generally shown in USD and only then calculated at local currency prices via the exchange rate. (E.g.: In Canada, exchanges list BTC/USD and then calculate the USD:CAD exchange rate to show the effective BTC/CAD rate.) 

**Observation**: USD has been falling in value steadily for the last year (as countries lose confidence in the U.S. and its currency) with a brief relief rally in Q3 before falling again in Q4. 

**The Scenario**: Imagine the international community chooses to drop the USD (or slow down its usage) and so the USD plummets in value on the world stage over the next year or two. 

**Question**: What's more likely?   
A) Cryptocurrencies drop in value in lockstep with dropping USD rates?   
B) Cryptocurrencies rise in value, as USD becomes worth less in comparison?   
C) Something else I'm not thinking about?

The interesting part isn’t just “how much BTC they hold”, it’s how the market prices the equity relative to the BTC on the balance sheet.



So I did a small case study on KULR’s BTC treasury disclosures and built a web dashboard that tries to make the data \*auditable\*:



What I track / calculate (high level):

\- BTC holdings + cost basis changes over time (from official filings/press releases)

\- mNAV-style ratio (how the equity trades vs BTC value)

\- “implied core value” framing (what the market is valuing beyond the BTC)

\- short interest and IV context (because these names often trade like proxies)



Methodology approach (the web app side):

\- ingest SEC filings (8-K / 10-Q / 10-K) + official press releases

\- keep every datapoint traceable back to a source doc (so it’s not vibes)

\- build a simple pipeline: parse > normalize > compute derived metrics > render charts

\----------------

The **interesting part for this sub** isn’t just KULR — it’s the *product pattern*:

The site uses a **utility token (KBT)** as an access key to unlock deeper analytics. Not a DeFi app, not a trading token — more like crypto-based entitlement for a data product.

I’m curious what people here think about:

1. Token-gated access for non-DeFi web apps — legit or doomed?
2. Better metrics to analyze BTC treasury equities beyond raw holdings?
3. Whether this pattern works better than subscriptions in crypto-native audiences.

In [Lesson 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qeo0bq/what_is_cryptocurrency_after_all_the_bitcoin/), we learned what CryptoCurrencies are and the Story of Bitcoin. In [Lesson 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qfrs8w/the_evolution_of_money_debt_barter_gold_fiat_and/), we learned the Evolution of Money. In [Lesson 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qge3x8/how_a_blockchain_works_the_public_ledger_explained/), we learned how the Blockchain works.

But if you look at the ""crypto"" world now, you won’t just see Bitcoin.

You will see literally millions of other ""cryptos"".

Where did they all come from?

The answer is in the nature of Bitcoin itself. It is **Open Source**.

This means the ""recipe"" for Bitcoin (the code) is public. Anyone can view it, download it, and copy it. And because humans are tinkerers, that is exactly what happened.

Developers looked at Bitcoin and said: *""This is cool, but I can make it better.""*

They copied the code, changed a few variables, and launched their own networks. We call these early attempts **Altcoins** (Alternative Coins).

Here is the story of the first ""Bitcoin Copies"" and the problems they tried to solve, categorized by the features they added to the concept of money.

# Category 1: The Quest for Speed

In 2011, a then Google engineer named Charlie Lee looked at Bitcoin and felt it was slow and was getting too heavy.

**The Problem:** Bitcoin was designed to be ""Gold"": heavy, secure, and somewhat slow to move.

1. **Speed:** Bitcoin blocks sometimes take **10 minutes** to confirm. That’s too slow.
2. **Mining:** Bitcoin used a math algorithm (SHA-256) that was quickly dominated by specialized industrial machines (ASICs). This meant regular people with home computers could no longer compete.

**The Solution:** Charlie Lee created the first major ""Altcoin"", called **Litecoin**.

If Bitcoin was Digital Gold, Litecoin was Digital Silver. Lighter, faster, and cheaper to move.

Litecoin was once the 2nd largest CryptoCurrency, and still remains a relevant player.

Now there are millions of pure currencies like Bitcoin, that claim to be lighter, faster, and cheaper.

This Educational series focus on information, so we will try to refrain from citing modern examples that are not historically relevant. This is not an endorsement of Litecoin or any other ""altcoin"". Same as with Bitcoin, none of this Educational series is investment advice and all decisions should be made with full information by professionals.

# Category 2: The Quest for Privacy

As Bitcoin grew, people realized something concerning about the ""Public Ledger"" we discussed in [Lesson 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qge3x8/how_a_blockchain_works_the_public_ledger_explained/): **It is completely public.**

**The Problem:** If you pay your landlord in Bitcoin, your landlord can look at the blockchain and see exactly how much money you have in your wallet. Bitcoin is pseudonymous (no name necessary), but not anonymous. If anyone links your identity to your wallet address, your entire financial history is exposed.

**The Solution:** Developers created **Privacy Coins**. Projects were built to be ""Digital Cash"", but when you hand someone a $20 bill, nobody else knows about it.

Privacy coins use complex cryptography (like Ring Signatures) to mix transactions together.

* The Sender is hidden.
* The Receiver is hidden.
* The Amount is hidden.

These currencies proved that a blockchain could be verifiable without relinquishing privacy.

# Category 3: The Quest for Efficiency

By 2012, people were concerned that Bitcoin mining (Proof of Work) consumed electricity.

**The Problem:** To secure Bitcoin, you have to burn energy. As the network grows, the energy consumption grows.

**The Solution:** Developers Sunny King and Scott Nadal created a coin using a radical new concept called **Proof of Stake (PoS)**. Instead of needing powerful hardware to solve math puzzles (Work), the network could be secured by the people holding the coins (Stake).

* If you hold coins, you can verify transactions, but if you ""lie"", you lose your coins.
* You don't need a mining farm; you just need a ""wallet"" holding coins.

Early versions of this technology faded from popularity, but its invention (Proof of Stake) changed the industry forever, paving the way for modern, greener blockchains we use today.

# Category 4: The Social Layer (memecoins)

Believe it or not, but in 2013, Crypto was mostly serious people, scientists, and nerds talking about math, software, and the concept of money itself. It was intense.

**The Problem:** Crypto was becoming too serious, complex, and inaccessible to ""normies"".

**The Solution:** Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer decided to make fun in the industry. They took the Litecoin code and replaced the branding with a popular internet meme: a Shiba Inu dog. They made it ridiculous on purpose:

After analyzing releases from 2017 to 2026, a clear pattern emerges: They extract maximum value from the network first, then sell you the scrap metal.

Below is the forensic breakdown of the ""Bait vs. Switch"" profitability for every major release.

1. **The ""Hall of Shame"" (Altcoin Rug Pulls)**

These miners were sold with ""God Mode"" ROI projections that evaporated the moment the first batch landed.

Antminer D3 (Dash)

The Textbook Trap.

The Bait (July 2017): Pre-orders opened with a projected income of \~$200 USD / day.

The Switch (Nov 2017): By the time Batch 1 arrived, difficulty had spiked 1,000%.

Real Profit on Delivery: \~$10 USD / day.

The Scam Score: 10/10. (Thousands of users essentially bought expensive paperweights).

Antminer A3 (Siacoin)

The 10-Day Pump.

The Bait (Jan 17, 2018): Released ""surprise"" style. Projected income \~$450 - $500 USD / day.

The Switch (Jan 27, 2018): Just 10 days later, as units landed, income crashed.

Real Profit on Delivery: \~$20 - $40 USD / day.

The Scam Score: 9/10. (Insiders likely front-ran the launch; public buyers got wrecked).

Antminer B3 (Bytom)

The Market Manipulation Special.

The Bait (April 2018): Bytom (BTM) price magically doubled to ATH ($1.16) exactly on announcement day.

The Switch (May 2018): Hardware shipped, price instantly collapsed to $0.30.

Real Profit on Delivery: Negative (after electricity) for many within 60 days.

The Scam Score: 9/10. (Suspicious price correlation).

**2. The ""Modern"" Era (2020–2026)**

The strategy shifted from ""crashing the coin"" to ""withholding the tech"" until the last possible moment.

Antminer E9 (Ethereum)

The Merge Liquidation.

The Bait (April 2021): Announced as ""Equivalent to 25 RTX 3080s"" during peak ETH mining profitability.

The Switch (July 2022): Withheld for 15 months (while Bitmain likely mined with it). Sold to public just 8 weeks before The Merge.

Real Profit on Delivery: High for \~60 days, then $0 (Brick).

The Scam Score: 10/10. (Selling hardware for a dying network).

Antminer KS3 (Kaspa)

The Nuclear Option.

The Bait (May 2023): Early projections showed insane numbers—\~$2,000 - $3,000 USD / day (at 8.3 TH/s).

The Switch (Aug 2023): Bitmain flooded the network. Difficulty went vertical.

Real Profit on Delivery: \~$60 - $80 USD / day (by early 2024).

The Scam Score: 7/10. (Still profitable, but the ""Day 1"" buyers paid $30k+ for a machine that lost 90% of its daily revenue power in months).

Antminer KA3 (Kadena)

The Centralizer.

The Bait (Sept 2022): 166 TH/s (5x powerful than competitors). Projected \~$70 - $80 USD / day.

The Switch: Bitmain likely strip-mined the 2021 KDA bull run (when KDA was $20+) with this tech secretly, then sold it when KDA was $1.50.

The Scam Score: 6/10. (Good hardware, but the release timing suggests they ate the best meals before inviting you to the table).

**3. The Bitcoin ""Futures"" Trap (BTC)**

They can't kill Bitcoin, so they kill your ROI by making you pay Bull Market prices for Bear Market delivery.

Antminer S19 XP (Bitcoin)

The Bait (Nov 2021): Bitcoin at $60k. Futures sold for $10,000 - $12,000 per unit.

The Switch (July-Sept 2022): Delivered when Bitcoin was $20k.

Real Profit on Delivery: Barely breakeven (depending on electric rate).

The Lesson: Never buy futures. You are financing their hedge.

If Bitmain announces a miner for a coin that has been ""quiet"" for years, do not buy it. It usually means they have found a way to exploit it and are looking for bagholders before the difficulty adjustment hits.

Good luck!

In [Lesson 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qeo0bq/what_is_cryptocurrency_after_all_the_bitcoin/), we learned that Bitcoin is ""digital cash"" that removes the bank from the middle. In [Lesson 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qfrs8w/the_evolution_of_money_debt_barter_gold_fiat_and/), we learned that money is a technology we use to track value, and Bitcoin could be the next evolution, fixing the infinite “money printing” of Fiat.

But this leaves a technical hole in the story.

If there is no bank... **who keeps track of the money?**

The answer is the engine that powers the entire industry. The **Blockchain**.

# The Problem: The Trust Gap

In the old world, you trusted the Bank to keep the ""Master Ledger"" (the record of all accounts) safe in their private books/ledger.

* Bob has 100 coins
* Alice has 20 coins
* Bob sent Alice 10 coins
* Bob now has 90 coins
* Alice now has 30 coins

You couldn't see it. You just had to trust that they wouldn't delete your money or freeze your account. Up until the 1960s, these books were physical. Currently, they are on the bank's servers.

https://preview.redd.it/qy9qifytu4eg1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efad36007b03065cee1ba5109d3b4b71eca5705c

In addition, you had to trust that the money kept its value. Even though, historically, fiat money has always gone to zero.

Satoshi Nakamoto realized that to build a decentralized currency, we didn't need a better bank. We needed to get rid of the secret book entirely.

And we needed to have control of the creation of this new form of money.

# The Solution: The Public Ledger

A ledger is basically a book.

Imagine a Book that anyone can read in the middle of the internet’s Town Square.

Anyone in town can walk up to this book and post a signed transaction.

“*Bob pays Alice 5 coins. Signed Bob”*

Everyone else can see it. Because everyone can see it, everyone knows exactly how much money everyone else has. You can’t lie and say “I have 100 coins” if the board clearly shows you only received 50.

In technical terms, this is a **Distributed Public Ledger**.

* **Distributed:** Everyone has a copy.
* **Public:** Anyone can read it.
* **Ledger:** It’s just a list of transactions.

This is only possible because we can verify digital signatures with reasonable security. This is due to a technical thing called “Public key/Private Key Cryptography”, a relatively recent mathematical advancements (from the 1970s) that computers and the internet allowed us to implement for this end. We can now verify that Bob signed the transaction without even the verifiers being able to fake Bob’s signature.

# Blocks and Chains

So, why is it called a ""Blockchain""?

Think of the entire history of Bitcoin transactions not as a random list, but as an organized ledger full of pages (blocks). The blocks are connected to each other, forming a chain of blocks.

https://preview.redd.it/e0nxtjsay4eg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8160c9da781d5ff2004b41218e919cef156748bc

1. **The Transaction:** You buy coffee. This data is written down.
2. **The Block (The Page):** Eventually, the page gets full of transactions. A ""Bookkeeper"" (Miner) verifies that the transactions are valid, seals the page, and adds a timestamp. This sealed page is a **Block**. The miner usually receives a small amount of BTC for this ""bookkeeping"". These are called ""mined bitcoin"". They may also receive a transaction fee from users.
3. **The Chain (The Glue):** This is the magic part. Before the Miner starts a *new* page, they take a mathematical ""fingerprint"" (hash) of the *previous* page and write it at the top of the new one. Like numbered pages.

This links all pages together digitally.

If even a single transaction or block is different, the entire chain collapses. The network sees the broken chain, rejects it, and accepts the real chain that everyone else is holding.

This makes the history of money **Immutable** (unchangeable).

# The First Page: The Genesis Block

Every chain has to start somewhere. You can trace every single Bitcoin in existence back to when it was first ""mined"", through the pages of history, all the way to **Page 1**.

We call this **The Genesis Block (Block 0)**.

When Satoshi Nakamoto mined this first block on January 3rd, 2009, he didn't just start a currency. He left a message inside the code of the first transaction: a digital timestamp to prove exactly when it began, and perhaps, *why* it began.

Included in the raw data of that first block was this text:

>*""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""*

Not saying ETH is dead or anything, it just hasn’t been doing that usual “ETH outperforms BTC” thing people got used to. And most alts vs BTC still look awful.

What’s interesting though is that a lot of the building that matters right now is not random microcaps, it’s boring institutional-ish sectors that keep shipping whether crypto Twitter is happy or not.

RWAs and tokenized funds are a big one. You’ve got Ondo pushing tokenized treasury exposure (USDY), BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL getting used as collateral, and then stuff like Centrifuge doing onchain credit / real-world lending rails that keep expanding even in a slow market.

Bitcoin staking is another obvious trend. Babylon is the headline example here, but the bigger point is “BTC as security” becoming a thing people actually build around instead of just talking about it. It’s basically the most politically acceptable crypto primitive right now, so it keeps attracting effort.

Interoperability is also getting more real and less “bridge got hacked again.” IBC Eureka is a good example of that direction, Union is pushing ZK-based interoperability, and you can feel the pressure for everything to become connected without trusting a multisig. Toki is coming too, and even LayerZero keeps showing up in these conversations whether people love it or hate it.

Stablecoins keep quietly eating the world. Circle is still the default “payments infra” name, Paxos keeps launching and expanding products, and we’re seeing more regulated / compliant flavors show up because that’s what institutions actually want.

And yeah, commodities is the sleeper category. Most crypto people don’t care until it’s already big, but if you can trade oil/gas style markets onchain with decent UX and settlement, that’s not a meme narrative, that’s real volume. Sphinx is one example that’s explicitly going after that lane.

Payments and settlement is the other “boring until it’s everywhere” sector. Ripple’s ODL is still a reference point for how crypto gets used when the goal is moving value, not farming points.

Also, if it isn’t clear, when I say “how do I live with myself” I am not implying I don’t want to live, I’m fine. Very annoyed with myself, much less wealthy than I should be, but otherwise fine.

So, story time (TL;DR: at the bottom)

I’ve been ‘in crypto’ since about 2018 and have now experienced two major cycles in which, at their peak, I had life changing money. Not “in theory” but literally right there and ready to sell, yet I didn’t both times…

I won’t give specific numbers since what I define as life changing for me may be different to you, but it very likely would have set me up rather well at my age, though perhaps not for life. We are talking buy a nice house and not care about working for a few years money.

The first time was in 2021, I had accumulated (over a couple of years) a healthy bag of a crypto called QNT, you might have heard of it. I was buying that sucker way before it was on people’s radar for cheap, in fact I was mocked in certain communities for being so bullish. Needless to say I was somehow right, and it really took off. I had ‘made it’. I saw all that potential sitting there, and what did I do? I flaked out, started worrying about taxes and missing out on more gains, and ended up rotating back into other projects which didn’t do as well (for a time.)

Fast forward to 2024 and somehow, against all odds, I was back. I had almost got to my previous high point via investing in other projects and, perhaps stupidly, rotating some of those gains back into even riskier projects. Amazingly, those moves paid off too. I couldn’t lose. At this point I am now even better off than I was back in 2021. And what did I do? NOTHING. I just sat on it, watched it slowly dissolve, and did nothing.

Now in the present day, I’ve had to sell small amounts to make ends meet, and move some stuff around, but most of the assets that were big in 2024, which I still hold, are utterly dead now. I can’t really see them making a comeback. I had beaten the casino twice, and never cashed out. Now I feel like lightning will not strike 3 times and I’m gonna be ‘that guy’ forever haha. I’m back to square one.

Honestly, how would you even approach this? What can I tell myself? I have no choice but to hold on at this point and hope something turns around from the ashes I’m holding onto, but I’m starting to think I missed the only opportunities I’ll ever have to make that sort of money due to self doubt, and to a much lesser extent, greed.

In [Lesson 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qeo0bq/what_is_cryptocurrency_after_all_the_bitcoin/), we established that Bitcoin is fundamentally a ""Public Ledger"": a new way of keeping score globally without needing a central bank.

But this usually leads to the biggest question people have: *""Okay, it’s a digital ledger. But why does a digital entry on a computer network have any actual value? Why is one Bitcoin worth thousands of dollars? Will it all go to zero or will it grow to infinity?""*

The answer is: it depends on the **Market**, which nobody can predict.

We have to zoom out. Let’s ask a question that most people go their entire lives without ever really thinking about:

**What is money, actually?**

https://preview.redd.it/w3i20zctqzdg1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1563f83470d20cb39cb2e32aa70d0ef13c647d4a

# Lesson 2: The Evolution of Money

Most people think money is the paper in their wallet. But money isn't a ""thing."" Money is a **technology** used to **calculate and communicate value**. And like all technology, it evolves to solve the problems of society.

To understand why Bitcoin may or may not have any value, we have to understand the problems it was built to solve. We have to look at the history of money.

# Stage 1: Debt and Barter

Some anthropologists and economists argue that the earliest form of money was **Debt**.

Early human tribes used a system of social **Credit and Debt**.

In a small tribe, if you needed shoes, the cobbler gave them to you. You wouldn’t swap anything with him right then and there. Instead, society kept a mental ledger: *""The cobbler gave Bob shoes; Bob owes him one.""*

There was also **Barter:**

* *I have a chicken.*
* *You have shoes.*
* *We swap.*

**The Problem:** These mental Debt and Barter systems only work in small groups where everyone knows and trusts each other. You can't run a global economy on ""I owe you one."" You need a way to transact with strangers you don't trust and to **Measure** the value of things.

# Stage 2: Commodity Money (Gold)

As trade expanded between strangers, humanity needed a “medium of exchange”. **A way to measure the value of things**. A “storage of value”. We needed something that everyone agreed had value.

We settled on **Commodity Money**. Items that had intrinsic value and were hard to find: seashells, rice, salt, cattle, and eventually, **precious metals like Gold and Silver.**

Gold became the king of money for thousands of years because it had unique properties. It was chemically stable (it doesn't rot or rust), it was divisible, and most importantly, it was **scarce**. Nature restricted the supply of gold. You couldn't just ""create"" more of it; you had to dig it out of the ground.

**The Problem:** Gold is heavy, hard to transport, and dangerous to secure. If you wanted to buy a house in another city, transporting a chest of gold coins was a massive security risk. It doesn't work well for fast, large-scale commerce.

https://preview.redd.it/oinu1emfnzdg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1df2bfba073be3a81b4500f84b15a2b950c0b08

# Stage 3: The Goldsmith's Receipt (The Birth of ""Banking"")

In medieval Europe, merchants got tired of carrying heavy bags of metal coins. So, they started leaving their gold with the local goldsmiths. Since goldsmiths worked with precious metals, they already had the strongest vaults and security.

The goldsmith would give the merchant a paper receipt that said: *""Whoever holds this paper can claim 10 Gold Coins from my vault.""*

Suddenly, a realization hit the marketplace: Why bother walking all the way back to the goldsmith to get the gold just to pay someone? Why not just give them the paper receipt?

The paper was light, easy to carry, and easy to use. This was **Representative Money**. The paper itself was worthless, but it was ""as good as gold"" because it was backed 1:1 by metal in a vault.

*(Fun Fact: These early goldsmiths and money-changers would conduct their business sitting on a long wooden bench in the market square. The Italian word for bench is* ***""banco""****. This is where we get the word* ***Bank***\*. Legend says that when a banker went broke, his bench was smashed: ""banco rotto"" - which gives us the word\* ***Bankruptcy***\*.)\*

**The Problem:** You had to trust the ""banco."" What if the goldsmith secretly printed more receipts than he had gold in the vault?

# Stage 4: Fiat Currency (The Current Standard)

For a long time, global currencies (like the US Dollar) were essentially ""goldsmith receipts"" backed by national gold reserves.

But starting in the 20th century, governments realized that tying their money to gold limited their ability to spend. If they needed to spend money or bail out an economy, they couldn't just print more money unless they found more gold.

Big investors were buying crypto consistently from October 2024, betting on Donald Trump's campaign promises, but they've stopped for two key reasons. First, the Senate failed to pass decisive crypto legislation. Second, Donald Trump has entered a dangerous standoff with the Fed Chair.

Proposed Senate amendments could make Trump's promise to turn the US into a global crypto hub impossible to fulfill. But for institutions, the president's attempts to control the Federal Reserve are even more alarming. Trump is obsessed with cutting interest rates, regardless of the inflation risks. We saw a similar scenario play out with Turkey's president. Threats and the firing of several central bank governors there led to rate cuts at the president's will, which ultimately crashed the lira's value by 80%.

Trump's policies didn't just push Bitcoin higher; they also boosted gold as confidence in the dollar wavered. So, with crypto regulation up in the air, institutional money pivoted to gold, lifting its price by 60%—its best performance since 1979. This investment shift is visible even within crypto exchanges and gateways. On the veteran exchange BTCC, quarterly trading volume for gold tokens started the year at $300 million and ballooned to $2.74 billion by Q4.

# Lesson 1: The Bitcoin Story

https://preview.redd.it/n3w9yqzw7rdg1.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54020c6a29e4f85bdf6f5c80f167e8d04d6192dc

Before the ETFs, the memecoins, and the hype, there was just an idea: **CryptoCurrency**.

Today, “crypto” is a trillion-dollar industry that can feel quite complex.

But if you strip away the noise and go back to [Bitcoin’s 2008 Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), the original intention was incredibly simple.

If you do not understand this foundation, nothing else in this space will make sense.

Let’s go back to day one.

So, what is a CryptoCurrency?

# The Problem: The Bank’s ""Book""

In the “old days”, if you wanted to send money digitally, you couldn't actually send it *directly* to another person. It was impossible.

The year is 2007, not that long ago.

If you wanted to send $100 to a friend in Japan, you had to go through a bank. And also, through a currency exchange, brokers, international money transfer government protocols, agencies, managers, and bookkeepers who oftentimes manually managed accounts and balances.

Why? Because the bank held the ""Master Book"". These centralized “ledgers” tracked who owned what and all the transfers that occurred.

https://preview.redd.it/6esn9z708rdg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4be0b84abc08c86485d314bf2f51291bee7a47f7

The process worked like this:

1. I ask my bank to send money.
2. They open their secret book to check if I have the funds.
3. They subtract $100 from my line.
4. They communicate with another bank (and many other institutions), which adds $100 to my friend's line in *their* secret book.

**This system is slow and requires a lot of trusted parties.**

Because the banks own the ledger, they have total control. They can charge high fees, take days to settle transactions, and can block anything you might want to do. If they don’t like who you are, they can simply close the book on you.

It sounds conspiratorial and is probably not an issue for the average person in a developed country, but if you are a persecuted journalist in a dictatorship, or 75% of the world’s poorest population, debanking and underbanking can be a real danger.

According to the World Bank's Financial Inclusion Project, over 3/4ths of adults remain unbanked or underbanked.

In essence, we had the internet for sending information freely, but we were still using medieval methods for sending value.

# The Breakthrough: Electronic Cash

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin Whitepaper and asked a radical question:

**What if we took the ""Master Book"" away from the banks and gave everyone a copy instead?**

Satoshi is the world famous anonymous person who arguably created the world’s first fully functional **Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash**.

The goal was to allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through any third parties (trustless).

It was the invention of digital transfers that didn't rely on a central authorities.

https://preview.redd.it/81jkqtg18rdg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5abcf73079843e04e4b07d48b7f50493df9e4b36

But you may be wondering: if there is no bank, who keeps the books? What stops people from sending the same digital $100 to two different people?

# The New Bookkeepers

To replace the bank, Bitcoin introduced a global, decentralized network of bookkeepers.

We call them **Miners**.

Instead of a guy in a suit validating your transaction, thousands of computers around the world compete to validate blocks of transactions. They don't know who you are, they don't care, they only check and bookkeep.

They simply verify the math and what you can send based on your password/private key. Then they update the public ledger (the Blockchain), and secure the network.

For the first time in human history, we had a way to transfer value globally that was completely permissionless. It bypassed the need for approvals and privacy destroying intermediaries.

# How does it work? With cryptography.

Basically a math proof that was used to allow Miners to verify transactions and keep balances without being able to steal funds or make fraudulent trades. They do a bunch of necessary and extra math, and receive a fee (possibly) in return for their hard work.

All Miners have to agree on all balances and transactions (for Bitcoin at least). This keeps the network secure.

That's why Bitcoin is considered the world's first functioning and widely adopted CryptoCurrency.

# It was just cash transfers for the internet age.

# Or was it???

Pretty quickly, Bitcoin started gaining value. How? A cryptocurrency built from nothing but “Miners” doing math?

The value of Bitcoin, however, is a subject for another time.

For now, we can understand the first problem that CryptoCurrency ever solved: cash. Hence the word Currency. But not every CryptoAsset is a CryptoCurrency.

A growth hack. A spam meta. Something shallow and disposable. But that’s not really true. What died was a permission structure.

For a brief window of time, Twitter stopped being a place where influence was granted and became a place where influence could be *earned*, even if imperfectly, even if messily. And that bothered the hell out of the people who already owned the high ground. 

InfoFi didn’t invent low-effort content. You could argue that’s revisionist history. Low-effort content is the native language of every engagement-based platform. Tons of content creators dive for the lowest rung, the easiest possible way to win views, likes, clicks, an ultimately, a pay check. YouTube didn’t need InfoFi to become clickbait hell. TikTok didn’t need InfoFi to flood feeds with recycled faces and synthetic voices. Instagram didn’t need InfoFi to turn into a carousel factory. Incentives create behavior. Always. Platforms know this, they design for it, and then they act shocked when users do exactly what they’re rewarded to do.

So when X says “this is about spam,” I don’t buy it. Spam was always tolerated when it served the house. Rage bait, reply bait, outrage loops, engagement pods dressed up as discourse. Those weren’t accidents. Those were features of an impression-based monetization system. X taught people how to behave, then blamed them for learning the lesson too well. And I personally hate that kind of content, I refuse to make it because that's not the brand I want to build for my audience, but I will acknowledge the success accounts who leverage these techniques have. But fads and metas change and if you make quality then you don't need to chase fads and metas.

What InfoFi in this case did do differently was remove the illusion that this type of content was organic.

InfoFi put a price tag on attention in a way that wasn’t routed through X itself. That’s the unforgivable sin. Once creators and projects realized they could coordinate distribution without paying the platform toll, InfoFi stopped being a curiosity and started being a threat. Not because it was perfect, but because it worked *well enough* to be visible.

That visibility is key. Platforms don’t kill experiments when they’re small. They kill them when they scale. And we all know there has been a ton of noise about infoFi, AI slop, bots, and just more and more and more garbage on the timeline.

And here’s the thing people won’t say because it sounds uncomfortable. InfoFi didn’t just surface bots. It surfaced *labor*. Real people. Often not from San Francisco, New York, or London. People from Nigeria, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Eastern Europe. People who don’t have inherited audiences, VC proximity, or blue-check credibility. People whose writing was suddenly worth more because it showed up consistently in the right place at the right time.

That’s why the word “farmer” stuck so easily. It’s a class insult. It's racist and demeaning. It always has been. It’s a way of saying “you’re not supposed to be here,” dressed up as a quality critique. Funny how the same low-effort post feels different depending on who posts it. One is “thought leadership”. The other is “spam.”

InfoFi broke that illusion. It said: if attention has value, then the people producing it should get paid, not just the people who already own the megaphone. That’s a deeply destabilizing idea if your power depends on gatekeeping distribution.

And yes, InfoFi had real problems. Anyone being honest will admit that. The early versions absolutely incentivized noise, automated replies, and copy and paste. Even engagement rings pretending to be communities. But what gets ignored is that many of these platforms were already correcting for that in a variety of ways, from cutting replies and tightening rules to penalizing obvious farming. Companies were created to protect IP such as KINETIK IP. Eight months ago looked nothing like the worst period people keep pointing to, and as with any market, we all adapt and evolve.

Which makes the timing interesting.

If this were really about improving quality, why now? Why a hard API cutoff instead of guardrails? Why kill the entire category instead of shaping it? Platforms don’t choose nuclear options unless something else is at stake.

I spend my days staring at lines of code, looking for the one weakness that could drain a protocol or the one ""backdoor"" a developer left open to rug their community.



If you browse this subreddit, you know the game. You see a token, it has a cool name, a hype website, and ""Devs Doxxed"" plastered all over the Telegram group. You get FOMO, you buy in, and 12 hours later... the chart looks like a cliff, and the liquidity is gone.

Most people blame ""whales"" or ""bad market conditions."" But 90% of the time, the scam was written directly into the code before the token even launched.

The good news? You don't need to be a master coder to spot the worst offenders. You just need to know where to look on Etherscan or BscScan.

Here is a deep dive into the Top 3 Red Flags that I check instantly when I open a contract. If I see any of these, I don’t care how good the website looks—I run.



Red Flag #1: The ""Honeypot"" Switch (Hidden Trade Restrictions)

You’ve probably heard the term ""Honeypot."" This is when you can buy a token, but you can’t sell it. The chart looks amazing—only green candles! But that’s because nobody is allowed to sell except the developer.

How do they do it? It’s rarely as simple as a button labeled StopSelling. They hide it in the \_transfer function.

What to look for: When I audit a contract for RD Auditors, I go straight to the \_transfer function. This function is called every time tokens move from one wallet to another (buying or selling).

A clean contract usually looks like this: \_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)

A malicious contract will have ""conditions"" attached to this transfer. Look for weird modifiers or ""require"" statements like:

require(isWhitelisted\[sender\], ""Not allowed"");

require(tradingOpen == true, ""Trading paused"");

The Scam: The developer will launch the token with tradingOpen = true. Everyone buys. Then, once the pot is big enough, they call a hidden function to set tradingOpen = false. Suddenly, your transaction fails every time you try to swap on Uniswap or PancakeSwap.

The ""Blacklist"" Trick: Some developers are smarter. They don't stop everyone from selling (because that looks suspicious on scanners). Instead, they let you buy, but the moment you buy, your wallet address gets automatically added to a isBlacklisted mapping. You are trapped individually, while new victims keep buying in.

My Advice: Check the ""Read Contract"" tab on the block explorer. If you see functions like blacklist, botList, or setMaxTxPercent, be extremely careful. Unless there is a very good reason for them (like actual bot protection), they are often used to freeze your funds.



Red Flag #2: The Hidden Mint (The Infinite Supply)

This is the classic ""Rug Pull.""

In a standard ERC-20 token, the TotalSupply is usually fixed. If it says 1,000,000 tokens, there should never be more than 1,000,000 tokens.

However, Solidity has a function called \_mint(). This function creates new tokens out of thin air.

The Scam: The developer creates a token with a supply of 1 million. They lock the liquidity pool so you feel safe. ""Liquidity Locked for 100 Years!"" they scream.

But, they left a backdoor in the code that allows the owner to call mint().

You buy the token at $1.00.

The Developer calls mint(devWallet, 10,000,000,000).

Now they have billions of tokens.

They dump them all into the liquidity pool.

Because there is suddenly massive supply, the price crashes to $0.00000001 instantly.

What I look for: Search the code specifically for the word mint. In a safe contract, mint should only exist in the constructor (the part of code that runs once when the token is born). If you see a function like this:

function increaseSupply(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {

\_mint(msg.sender, amount);

}

Run. There is absolutely zero reason for a ""meme coin"" or a ""community token"" to have a mint function accessible by the owner after launch. If they can print money, your investment is worthless.  


Red Flag #3: Unverified Source Code

This is the biggest red flag of them all, and yet people still fall for it every day.

When a developer deploys a smart contract, they upload ""Bytecode"" (a string of numbers and letters that computers understand but humans can't read). To prove they are honest, they are supposed to ""Verify"" the source code on Etherscan. This translates that gibberish back into readable English/Solidity so auditors like us can check it.

The Scam: If you go to the ""Contract"" tab on the explorer and it says:

""Are you the contract owner? Verify and Publish your source code today!""

Or you see just a wall of hex code (0x6080604052600436106100...)

DO NOT BUY.

If the code is unverified, you have no idea what it does. It could be a honeypot. It could have a 99% tax. It could just send your ETH directly to the dev's wallet.

Why do they do this? Scammers often claim: ""We are keeping the code secret to protect our u ...[truncated]","3 Red Flags in Smart Contracts I Look For Before Investing (A Solidity Dev’s Perspective)

Here is a deep dive into the Top 3 Red Flags that I check instantly when I open a contract. If I see any of these, I don’t care how good the website looks—I run.



Red Flag #1: The ""Honeypot"" Switch (Hidden Trade Restrictions)

You’ve probably heard the term ""Honeypot."" This is when you can buy a token, but you can’t sell it. The chart looks amazing—only green candles! But that’s because nobody is allowed to sell except the developer.

How do they do it? It’s rarely as simple as a button labeled StopSelling. They hide it in the \_transfer function.

What to look for: When I audit a contract for RD Auditors, I go straight to the \_transfer function. This function is called every time tokens move from one wallet to another (buying or selling).

A clean contract usually looks like this: \_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)

A malicious contract will have ""conditions"" attached to this transfer. Look for weird modifiers or ""require"" statements like:

require(isWhitelisted\[sender\], ""Not allowed"");

require(tradingOpen == true, ""Trading paused"");

The Scam: The developer will launch the token with tradingOpen = true. Everyone buys. Then, once the pot is big enough, they call a hidden function to set tradingOpen = false. Suddenly, your transaction fails every time you try to swap on Uniswap or PancakeSwap.

The ""Blacklist"" Trick: Some developers are smarter. They don't stop everyone from selling (because that looks suspicious on scanners). Instead, they let you buy, but the moment you buy, your wallet address gets automatically added to a isBlacklisted mapping. You are trapped individually, while new victims keep buying in.

My Advice: Check the ""Read Contract"" tab on the block explorer. If you see functions like blacklist, botList, or setMaxTxPercent, be extremely careful. Unless there is a very good reason for them (like actual bot protection), they are often used to freeze your funds.



Red Flag #2: The Hidden Mint (The Infinite Supply)

This is the classic ""Rug Pull.""

In a standard ERC-20 token, the TotalSupply is usually fixed. If it says 1,000,000 tokens, there should never be more than 1,000,000 tokens.

However, Solidity has a function called \_mint(). This function creates new tokens out of thin air.

The Scam: The developer creates a token with a supply of 1 million. They lock the liquidity pool so you feel safe. ""Liquidity Locked for 100 Years!"" they scream.

But, they left a backdoor in the code that allows the owner to call mint().

You buy the token at $1.00.

The Developer calls mint(devWallet, 10,000,000,000).

Now they have billions of tokens.

They dump them all into the liquidity pool.

Because there is suddenly massive supply, the price crashes to $0.00000001 instantly.

What I look for: Search the code specifically for the word mint. In a safe contract, mint should only exist in the constructor (the part of code that runs once when the token is born). If you see a function like this:

function increaseSupply(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {

\_mint(msg.sender, amount);

}

Run. There is absolutely zero reason for a ""meme coin"" or a ""community token"" to have a mint function accessible by the owner after launch. If they can print money, your investment is worthless.  


Red Flag #3: Unverified Source Code

This is the biggest red flag of them all, and yet people still fall for it every day.

When a developer deploys a smart contract, they upload ""Bytecode"" (a string of numbers and letters that computers understand but humans can't read). To prove they are honest, they are supposed to ""Verify"" the source code on Etherscan. This translates that gibberish back into readable English/Solidity so auditors like us can check it.

The Scam: If you go to the ""Contract"" tab on the explorer and it says:

""Are you the contract owner? Verify and Publish your source code today!""

Or you see just a wall of hex code (0x6080604052600436106100...)

DO NOT BUY.

If the code is unverified, you have no idea what it does. It could be a honeypot. It could have a 99% tax. It could just send your ETH directly to the dev's wallet.

Why do they do this? Scammers often claim: ""We are keeping the code secret to protect our u ...[truncated]",67,0.91,20,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qe6bf0/3_red_flags_in_smart_contracts_i_look_for_before/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qe6bf0/3_red_flags_in_smart_contracts_i_look_for_before/,negative,"Warning about scams, negative tone."

**I** Risked strictly $200. Max potential was $2k, but I secured **$1,600 realized profit** after scaling out along the way.

Be wary,"So apparently Phantom keeps the private key completely unencrypted on the machine. I'm unsure how my key even got stolen, I considered myself tech savvy and ironically I work in the industry. This was my gambling wallet anyway so funds were prepared to be lost but still.

I'm still unsure how it happened, but I've isolated the issue to browser token compromise similar to this:

[https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/crypto-users-blame-phantom-wallet-for-500000-hack-file-lawsuit](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/crypto-users-blame-phantom-wallet-for-500000-hack-file-lawsuit)



No private key revealed at any point (I used Google Sign in), Google account was not stolen or hacked, and I never signed anything malicious (the logs back all of these statements up). 

The going theory is that somehow something got into the cache on Opera GX and stole the unencrypted private key. If I knew this was a vulnerability I would never have used Phantom in the first place. I had close to 150k in XMR on my machine, it did not get stolen and I moved it to exchange immediately, I was sweating bullets when I was waiting for the wallet to sync so I could send off, thinking I may have been fully hacked.  
I had a Metamask wallet with $500 on it in the same browser, it did not get stolen. Only Phantom did. 

No rogue extensions outside Ublock Origin.

  
Anyway here was the transaction: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8985eec0eba963b95789776fc1d0d8eebea2bfea11f8fe2c54fe9053863e6502](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8985eec0eba963b95789776fc1d0d8eebea2bfea11f8fe2c54fe9053863e6502)

They turned all my shitty memecoins into ETH and yoinked it, did the same on my Solana side of things (about $1000 there). 

  
Conclusion: I wouldn't use Phantom again, and I would advise you don't use it either. Pkey should not be sitting unencrypted in the browser cache.","My Phantom wallet got hacked a while back. Be wary

So MetaMask seems to be absolutely freaking useless as there's no option to reset the password and the AI customer Service is a joke as it's not helpful at all...

A lot of people are asking whether deflation and increased usage would actually move the price. In simple terms, deflation plus real demand should create upward pressure, that’s just supply and demand. Mission 70 aims to cut ICP issuance while increasing burn through onchain usage via cycles. What matters is paid usage that actually consumes cycles, not demos, testnets, or grant funded experiments. This doesn’t flip a switch overnight, there’s always a lag and plenty of volatility. Lower inflation also changes expectations, and markets often price that in early. Reduced issuance won’t eliminate sell pressure from early holders, stakers, or node operators.

Last Thursday, [Polygon announced our vision for the Open Money Stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1q7fuu8/comment/nylkd37/): an open and integrated stack of services and technologies designed to move money instantly and reliably anywhere.

The announcement laid out how Polygon is approaching the next era of global money movement, where money moves like information: instant, global, programmable, and always available.

Following the announcement, we want to come directly to the community to answer questions and go deeper.

We’re hosting an AMA to answer any questions you may have.

# What we’ll be discussing

**The Open Money Stack**

The Open Money Stack is Polygon’s approach to moving all money onchain. It brings together blockchain rails, wallets, interoperability, on- and off-ramps, compliance, identity, and onchain earning into one integrated system. The goal is to make money movement simple, reliable, and invisible to users, while remaining open and interoperable for builders.

**Recent acquisitions: Coinme and Sequence**

As part of the new vision and building the Open Money Stack, Polygon is acquiring [Coinme ](https://coinme.com/)and [Sequence](https://sequence.xyz/). These additions strengthen Polygon’s ability to support real-world money movement end to end, from onboarding users from traditional financial systems to providing scalable wallets and orchestration infrastructure onchain.

**Why this moment matters**

Roughly two quadrillion dollars move through global payment systems every year. While the full migration of money onchain will take time, the systems that define how it works will be established over the next few years. The Open Money Stack is Polygon’s response to that moment.

**Interoperability and unified money flow**

Money should move across chains as easily as it moves within them. Through interoperability technologies like Agglayer, Polygon is working toward a future where chains are invisible to users and money flows as if everything were part of a single system.

**What this means for POL holders and stakers**

Polygon has already facilitated over two trillion dollars in onchain value transfer. As usage grows, validators and stakers secure that activity and earn fees, with long-term upside tied to real-world adoption of onchain money.

The Open Money Stack, Coinme, Sequence, interoperability, payments, onchain money, adoption, staking, or where Polygon is headed next.

The platform is powered by the Dolomite protocol, a relatively unknown and small protocol, instead of the two leading lending protocols in DeFi, Aave and Morpho. This is the first time Dolomite has been selected by a major project as the lending infrastructure. 

World Liberty Markets allows users to supply and borrow assets including USD1 (their dollar-pegged stablecoin), ETH, cbBTC, USDC, USDT, and WLFI tokens. Dolomite handles the underlying infrastructure for direct onchain settlements.

Following the launch announcement, the DOLO token (native to Dolomite) rose sharply, jumping ~68% in the 24 hours after the news. 

One point worth noting: World Liberty Financial has had Dolomite co-founder Corey Caplan on board as an advisor since at least mid-2025. This direct tie has fueled discussion in crypto circles about whether the choice of Dolomite over Aave or Morpho involved preferential treatment or seeded liquidity arrangements to benefit insiders tied to the Trump-linked venture.

With USD1 now at a reported $3.4–3.5B market cap and the project pursuing a U.S. national trust bank charter for stablecoin operations, the move expands its DeFi footprint, but it also keeps the spotlight on potential conflicts of interest given the high-profile political ties and family equity stake (around 38% via affiliated entities, plus significant token holdings and revenue shares).","Trump family World Liberty Financial selects Dolomite for its core lending infrastructure.

Has anybody done tax on crypto in the UK recently that can explain please?

I would maybe rethink even pursuing this if the tax is too high.

For the longest of time, they kept harping about improving their so called sharding tech ( Zilliqa is the first coin to do that btw) and for many years, Zilliqa was just a coin claiming to use sharing, but slower than a drunk tortoise !!!!

now with their newer 2.0 architecture, this tech, speed and sharding is a serious contender for global adoption. 

A few things that caught my attention:

* Noticeable performance improvements
* Transaction finality and throughput are now genuinely fast in real usage, not just on paper. Micro-transactions and contract interactions feel near-instant, which is where many chains still struggle.
* Much smoother developer experience
* Tooling, SDKs, and smart contract workflows have matured a lot. Scilla used to be a barrier; now it’s clearer, safer, and better documented. The learning curve is still there, but it finally feels intentional rather than limiting.
* More practical use of sharding
* Instead of being a marketing bullet point, sharding on Zilliqa actually contributes to stability under load. Network behaviour during higher activity is far more consistent than it used to be.
* Steady ecosystem cleanup
* Less noise, fewer abandoned experiments, and more focus on infrastructure, gaming, and real throughput-heavy use cases. It feels like a platform that chose refinement over hype.

What I find interesting is that Zilliqa isn’t chasing trends loudly. No constant rebranding, no daily announcements — just incremental technical progress that’s starting to show in performance.

Not saying it’s perfect, and it’s clearly not trying to be everything at once. But if you care about speed, deterministic execution, and a chain that’s visibly more mature than it was a couple of years ago, it’s worth a fresh look from a tech perspective alone.

Curious if others here have noticed the same improvements, especially devs who’ve built on it recently. 

I do own this coin again, had sold all of it out of frustration a few months back, but revisting and looking at the performance of this chain now, have my hopes high that this will be a serious contender for future top coins and in turn my crypto moonshot which I have not been able to experience even once yet ( inspite of being soo close many times haha) . any other Zilliqa users here who use this or is this chain already too late and big chains like Solana, Ethereum  have not chance of being displaced now ? in which case Zilliqs name should be changed to zzzzilliqa (been sleeping too long lol) haha","Zilliqa’s recent upgrades quietly fixed what used to hold it back (and the speed is honestly impressive)

Thanks a lot!

For an early-stage B2B SaaS, especially in an emerging market, it often makes sense to start ads once you have a solid grasp of your value props and a clear ICP-otherwise you’re just burning cash guessing. Instead of spreading thin across platforms right away, lean into channels where you can hyper-target decision-makers; LinkedIn is a natural fit but can get pricey, and Meta can surprise you if you target by job title or industry interests.

With limited funds, aim for learning over scaling. Test creatives and messaging with small daily budgets, then double down on what’s moving the needle. That’s exactly where something like Didoo AI shines - it automates testing and optimization so you’re not stuck manually fiddling with audiences and creatives all day, which is a huge time and budget saver early on.

Nothing beats founder-to-founder: be patient, track unit economics closely, and treat your ad spend as a research budget until your funnel’s solid. Ads are worth it, just not before you’ve nailed what you’re actually selling and who’s actually buying.

before you burn money on ads, i'd focus on outbound first for b2b. Ads can get expensive fast and in an emerging market you prob don't have enough search volume or clear targeting yet to make paid worth it. some people swear by SMB Sales Boost for finding newly registered businesses to prospect, which sounds perfect for payment processing since you can catch them early before they pick a solution.

Way cheaper than ads and more direct for b2b imo. once you have some paying customers from outbound, then you'll actually know your CAC and can test small ad budgets on LinkedIn (best for b2b but pricey) or maybe Google if there's seach volume in your niche.

Yes, that’s my impression as well. We were thinking of testing a specific country, like India, since we’re going to adopt Indian payment methods.

Do you have experience in fintech marketing?

Ads make sense after you know exactly who buys, why, and how long sales take.
In emerging B2B markets, ads usually educate more than they convert which gets expensive fast.
Early on, founder-led sales, content, and direct conversations beat paid traffic.
Ads work best once you’re amplifying something that already closes, not trying to discover it.

For a B2B processor in an emerging market, ads are usually a bad first move until you know exactly who closes and why.



What worked for me: pick one narrow segment (e.g., mid-size wholesalers, SaaS resellers, etc.), do 20–30 discovery calls, and close 3–5 customers via pure outbound + referrals. Until you can consistently get someone to say “yes” on a call, ads just help you waste money faster.



I’d start with:

\- Direct outreach: LinkedIn DMs, warm intros, industry WhatsApp/Telegram groups.

\- Answering niche questions: here on Reddit, local forums, founder/SMB communities.



Channels later: Google Search for high-intent “B2B payments \[your country\]”, maybe Reddit/Meta retargeting, and I’d only touch LinkedIn once ACV is high and positioning is tight.



For tiny budgets, think in experiments: $300–$500 per channel to buy learning, not growth. I’ve used HubSpot and Apollo for outbound, and Pulse to surface Reddit threads where people are literally complaining about payments so I can jump in with something specific. So the point: nail one narrow use case via hand-to-hand selling before you pump money into ads.",4,1.0,24,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1quxvfj/never_ran_ads_in_my_life_looking_for_advice_for_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1quxvfj/never_ran_ads_in_my_life_looking_for_advice_for_a/,neutral,"User is asking for advice, no strong positive or negative emotion expressed."

i’m trying to put together a short list of the best data security solutions that actually help reduce risk without turning into a never-ending tuning project. we’re dealing with the usual mix of cloud storage, saas apps, and a bunch of data scattered across teams, and i’m stuck between “buy a platform” vs “best-of-breed everything.” what tools have you used that genuinely made things better (visibility, access control, detection, incident response), and what tools sounded amazing but were a pain in real life?

I work in fintech product ops, so my perspective is skewed heavily toward payment security and compliance, but we’ve wrestled with the ""platform vs. point solution"" headache a lot recently.

In my experience, ""best-of-breed"" usually just means ""integration nightmare"" unless you have a dedicated devops team to stitch it all together.

The ""buy a platform versus best-of-breed"" question is the right starting point because the answer determines how much of your life you want to spend on integration work.

The platform approach wins for most mid-size teams. Running separate tools for DLP, CASB, access control, and detection sounds great until you're maintaining five different policy engines that don't talk to each other and your analysts are swiveling between four dashboards. The integration tax is real and it compounds every time you add a new SaaS app or cloud service.

What actually works in practice. For cloud and SaaS visibility, Microsoft Purview is solid if you're already a Microsoft shop. It covers DLP, classification, and access monitoring across M365 and Azure natively. The cross-platform coverage is weaker but if 70% of your data lives in Microsoft's ecosystem it's the path of least resistance. If you're multi-cloud or Google-heavy, Netskope or Palo Alto's DSPM do a decent job of discovery and classification across environments.

The tools that sound amazing but become tuning nightmares are almost always DLP solutions. Every vendor demos beautifully with clean data and predefined policies. In production you're drowning in false positives within a week because real data doesn't look like demo data. Our clients who've had success with DLP started extremely narrow, one data type, one channel, tuned until false positive rate was manageable, then expanded. The teams who turned everything on day one abandoned the tool within six months.

For access control, the boring answer is usually right. Proper IAM hygiene, regular access reviews, and least-privilege enforcement through your identity provider catches more risk than any fancy tool. Veza or ConductorOne can help automate access reviews if manual reviews are falling behind.

Detection and response is where best-of-breed sometimes wins. Your SIEM or XDR platform handles the detection layer but data-specific alerts often need a specialized tool feeding signals into it rather than trying to make the SIEM understand data context natively.

The one thing I'd prioritize above any tool purchase is knowing where your sensitive data actually lives. You can't protect what you can't see. Start with discovery and classification before buying protection tools.",24,0.92,7,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1quos2w/best_data_security_solutions_whats_actually_worth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1quos2w/best_data_security_solutions_whats_actually_worth/,neutral,"Balanced discussion of pros and cons, no strong positive or negative bias"

I’ve noticed a pattern with fintech startups: solid ideas, clean MVPs, even early traction, but then growth flatlines. Distribution gets expensive, compliance slows experimentation, and teams struggle to balance speed with trust.
For founders or operators here: what actually helped you move from “working product” to sustainable growth in fintech? Was it partnerships, better UX, fundraising timing, or something else?

The pattern is real and it's almost always the same few causes.

Distribution in fintech is brutally expensive because trust is the product. Nobody switches financial infrastructure based on a landing page. CAC reflects the fact that you're asking people to trust you with money, and most MVPs stall because founders budgeted for product development but not for the 12-18 months of grinding through sales cycles where prospects say ""love it but need to see you survive another year.""

Compliance compounds in ways teams don't anticipate. Your MVP launched with basic KYC. Now every new feature needs updated policies, legal review, maybe a new license. Each expansion costs more in compliance overhead than engineering.

What actually moved the needle for our clients who got past the stall. Partnerships with established players was the most common unlock, solving trust and distribution simultaneously. Narrowing focus rather than expanding, owning one use case for one segment completely rather than being mediocre across five. And unit economics clarity early so you know whether to raise, pivot pricing, or change channels.

The uncomfortable truth is most fintech MVPs stall because the market they targeted isn't big enough to sustain the compliance and distribution costs required to serve it.

One day you hear “crypto is banned.”  
Next day you’re paying **30% tax** on it.  
So what’s the truth?

**Short answer:**  
Crypto is **not banned** in India, but it’s also **not accepted as money**.

And that weird in-between space is where most of the frustration comes from.



# How India Really Treats Crypto 

The government doesn’t call Bitcoin or crypto “currency.”  
Instead, it labels it **Virtual Digital Assets (VDA)**.

What does that mean in real life?

* You’re allowed to buy, sell, and hold crypto
* You’re taxed heavily if you make profits (30% )
* There’s 1% TDS on every transaction, even if you’re not making money
* You can’t use losses to reduce other taxes
* Exchanges must follow strict KYC and AML rules

So yes, it’s legal… but it doesn’t exactly feel encouraged.



# Why People Are So Confused 

Back in 2020, the Supreme Court lifted the RBI banking ban.  
That gave people hope.

But since then:

No clear crypto law

No official regulator

No clarity on long-term direction

It feels like crypto exists in India with a big **“allowed, but at your own risk”** label.



India hasn’t said “yes” to crypto.  
It hasn’t said “no” either.

I’m a PM at a mid-sized fintech with a card program and we are looking for a way to auto-update payment methods across different merchants when users get new cards (due to expiration, lost/stolen etc). Looking for something with solid merchant coverage and decent security. What are y'all using?

You're looking for card-on-file updater services. The options depend on whether you're an issuer or working through a processor.

Visa Account Updater (VAU) and Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) are the network-level services that handle this. As a card issuer or program manager, you push updated card details to the networks and participating merchants automatically receive the new credentials. Coverage is decent but not universal since merchants have to participate, and not all do.

The catch is you don't integrate with these directly in most cases. Your issuer processor or BIN sponsor handles the network connectivity. So the real question is whether your current processor supports VAU/ABU and how well their implementation works. Some processors handle it seamlessly, others have it technically available but the enrollment and data flow is clunky.

If you're on Marqeta, Lithic, or similar modern issuer platforms, they generally have account updater built in or easily enabled. The implementation is mostly configuration rather than heavy engineering. Older processors may require more manual work to get it running properly.

The coverage gap is real though. Not every merchant participates in the network updater programs. Subscription services and large retailers generally do because failed recurring charges cost them money. Smaller merchants often don't bother. So you'll reduce failed transactions significantly but won't eliminate them entirely.

Our clients running card programs typically see 60-70% of card-on-file relationships updated automatically through the network services. The remaining 30-40% still result in declines that the cardholder has to fix manually.

One thing to discuss with your processor is the timing. Some implementations push updates in batch which can take days, others are near real-time. For lost/stolen replacements the speed matters since you want merchants updated before the next billing cycle hits.",21,0.94,4,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1qu1gxl/whats_the_best_api_for_updating_cards_across/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1qu1gxl/whats_the_best_api_for_updating_cards_across/,neutral,"Informative content, no positive or negative emotional tone."

I’m working on an idea to build a custom crypto wallet that can be linked to a physical card (prepaid or regular magnetic/chip card). Right now, I’m still learning how everything works under the hood.

I’m starting with the Ethereum network and focusing specifically on stablecoins. My main question is: if I create a custom wallet, how can stablecoins from that wallet be used directly with payment processing vendors (for example, for everyday card payments)?

The inspiration behind this idea comes from neo-banks that allow users to “be their own bank.” My goal is to stay focused on stablecoins and understand whether this concept is technically and practically possible before moving further.

Thanks in advance for any insights.

The short answer is you don't connect a wallet directly to a card. There's always an intermediary layer that converts crypto to fiat at the point of transaction.

The way every existing crypto card actually works is this. User holds stablecoins in a wallet or account. When they tap their card at a merchant, a processor converts USDC or whatever stablecoin into fiat in real-time, and the merchant receives normal dollars through normal card rails. The merchant never knows or cares that crypto was involved. Visa and Mastercard process it like any other transaction.

The stack you'd need to build this involves several layers. First, a BIN sponsor or issuer processor who will let you issue cards. Marqeta, Lithic, and similar platforms provide card issuing as a service. They handle the actual card network connectivity so you don't need direct Visa/Mastercard membership. Second, an on/off ramp that converts stablecoins to fiat when a transaction is authorized. This has to happen in milliseconds because card authorization timeouts are tight. Third, a custodial or semi-custodial wallet layer because the card processor needs to be able to guarantee funds are available at authorization time. Fully non-custodial wallets create a problem here since you can't ask the user to sign a transaction while they're standing at a checkout counter.

The ""be your own bank"" framing breaks down at the card layer specifically because card networks are centralized infrastructure by design. You can give users self-custody of their stablecoins right up until they want to spend via card, at which point something custodial has to bridge the gap.

Our clients exploring this space have found that the technical build isn't the hard part. The regulatory and partnership requirements are. You need money transmission licenses, a relationship with an issuer processor willing to work with crypto, and compliance infrastructure that satisfies both crypto regulations and card network rules.",2,1.0,5,0,True,False,False,False,False,https://reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1qtlwmk/how_to_link_your_custom_plastic_card_with_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1qtlwmk/how_to_link_your_custom_plastic_card_with_a/,neutral,"Informative explanation, no strong emotion"

I’ve just come out the other side of what can only be described as a completely disproportionate overreach by Airwallex, and I feel people choosing fintech banks deserve to know how bad this can get.

Short version:

A routine B2B dispute (\\\\\\\~£5k) was escalated by Airwallex into a POCA (Proceeds of Crime Act) account freezing order, locking six figures of legitimate business funds.

The police reviewed the evidence and applied to court to lift the freeze almost immediately.

That alone should tell you something.

⸻

What happened

	•	Long-standing trading business, compliant, VAT-registered, with documented turnover.

	•	One customer raised a dispute on a wholesale order (commercial disagreement, not fraud).

	•	Airwallex froze the entire account, not just the disputed amount.

	•	Without warning, this escalated into a POCA freezing order via law enforcement.

	•	No charges. No allegations. No explanation at the time.

I was then required to:

	•	Submit invoices

	•	Submit bank statements

	•	Explain business model

	•	Attend an interview (civil, not under caution)

After reviewing the documents, the police officer herself applied to court to set aside the POCA order.

The court agreed.

⸻

The problem

This wasn’t fraud.

This wasn’t money laundering.

This wasn’t criminal.

It was a commercial dispute, and Airwallex treated it like organised crime.

What’s terrifying is:

	•	POCA is designed for serious criminal proceeds

	•	Airwallex appears willing to trigger it over routine business disputes

	•	The freeze applied to all funds, not the disputed amount

	•	There is no meaningful warning, timeline, or recourse while it happens

Even worse:

The police cleared it faster than Airwallex froze it.

That tells you where the real dysfunction sits.

⸻

Why this matters

If you’re a:

	•	founder

	•	international trader

	•	high-volume business

	•	business relying on USD/EUR rails

You need to understand this risk.

When fintech banks say “we may freeze your account for compliance”, what they really mean is:

We can remove your access to working capital instantly, escalate it to law enforcement, and let you fight to prove innocence.

Even if you’ve done nothing wrong.

⸻

My takeaway

	•	Airwallex is extremely risk-averse to the point of recklessness

	•	POCA should be a last resort — not a compliance shortcut

	•	The damage to a business during a freeze is real, immediate, and severe

	•	Being “cleared” doesn’t undo the disruption

I’m not naming myself or my company, but I would not choose Airwallex again, and I strongly suggest anyone considering them understands this risk before trusting them with material balances.

Thoughts appreciated!

The ""path toward compliance"" story works until it doesn't, and in fintech it stops working earlier than most founders expect.

Since you're handling real-time account information and customer PII, prospects will ask about SOC 2 almost immediately. Small design partners might accept a security questionnaire. The moment you're talking to any company with 50+ employees or a regulated entity, their infosec team needs something real.

Start with SOC 2 Type I. It's a point-in-time assessment that's cheaper and faster than Type II. Most buyers will accept it while you work toward Type II which requires a 3-12 month monitoring period. Our clients in fintech have found that Type I is usually needed before closing your first paying customer outside design partners.

Cost optimization is using Vanta, Drata, or similar from day one. Few hundred bucks a month but they automate evidence collection so you're not scrambling when the auditor shows up. Starting early means building compliant habits into your infrastructure rather than retrofitting, which is always more expensive.

Budget 2-3 months and $15-25k for the Type I audit itself if you've been using compliance automation.

It is a huge selling point and must-have if you are selling to large companies. The deal can often stop if you do not have it.

I'd suggest to check out some of your would-be competitors and see whether they've got SOC 2. That'll be a good benchmark.

Would you recomend start something in the field

Instant visibility on-chain sounds impressive, but in practice that problem is already being solved inside the banking system. Real-time payment rails and modern P2P infrastructures mean funds can reach accounts in seconds with clear references and identity tied to the transfer. For most businesses, “I see it in my bank instantly” versus “I see it in my wallet instantly” is not a game-changing difference.


Also, seeing that money was sent is not the same as having protection. Businesses care about dispute mechanisms, fraud controls, legal recourse, and compliance frameworks when something goes wrong. A transaction hash does not replace those institutional safeguards.


Add to that IBAN name checks, confirmation-of-payee systems, and increasingly sophisticated fraud monitoring, and the “I don’t know who paid me” issue is far less relevant than it used to be.


Stablecoins improve speed and transparency, no question. But they are enhancing the payments layer, not removing the need for the financial and legal infrastructure that banks provide.

People have been declaring “the end of banking” for literally centuries. Every time a new financial technology shows up, credit, telegraph transfers, cards, online banking, fintech, now stablecoins, the same story plays out. Old system is “finished.” It never is.


Banks are not just money pipes. They are:

• legal trust layers, identity, compliance, dispute handling

• credit engines, loans, trade finance, risk management

• bridges to the real economy, taxes, courts, payroll, regulation


Stablecoins are great at moving value fast. That is one slice of what banks do. They do not replace balance sheets, lending, deposit protection, or the legal framework businesses rely on when something goes wrong.
Most huge stablecoin volume numbers also mix in trading, arbitrage, and automated on-chain activity, not just real business payments. Growth is real, but “this killed banks” is a massive leap.


What actually happens historically is simple. New tech appears. Banks either integrate it or build around it. Cards did not kill banks. Online did not kill banks. Fintech did not kill banks. Stablecoin rails will likely become another layer inside the system, not a funeral for it.


The only constant in finance is that the plumbing evolves. The institutions managing trust and credit just keep changing shape, not disappearing.

I think this hits the nail on the head. Tech's not the issue anymore; it's about getting things out there, dealing with the rules, and whether people actually want what's being offered. Tokenization is obviously useful when it fixes a problem in the market, like with repurchase agreements, private credit, or quicker settlements. But for things like real estate or art? You're not really making things more liquid; you're just changing the shape of something that's hard to sell and hoping someone buys it. Unless big players are ready to hold and trade these tokens big time, it'll stay a small thing or just part of the behind-the-scenes stuff, not a big money-maker. That’s why it seems like the real stuff is going on quietly in the background with infrastructure and payments, not with all the fancy tokenize everything talk. It's also where you see actual connections being made between regular finance and crypto, like those regulated fintech things that handle both regular money and crypto.

Not pitching anything, just doing honest discovery on where existing tooling helps and where it clearly stops.

The workflow fragmentation is worse than most people realize.

What teams actually use is EDGAR for raw filings, AlphaSense or Intelligize for search, Bloomberg for structured data if they have access, and then Excel and Word for actual comparison work. The specialized tools get you 70% there but final synthesis happens manually.

Cross-company comparison is embarrassingly manual. Analysts pull relevant sections from multiple filings, paste them side by side, and read through highlighting differences. XBRL helps for quantitative items but narrative disclosures have no standard format. Our clients doing competitive analysis spend hours on comparison work that feels automatable but isn't.

Tracking narrative changes over time is where tooling actually helps. Diff tools showing year-over-year changes are useful. The challenge is distinguishing meaningful changes from boilerplate updates responding to new SEC requirements.

What doesn't work well is LLM summarization. Summaries lose specific language that matters. When a company changes ""we believe our liquidity is adequate"" to ""we expect our liquidity to be adequate,"" that word choice shift signals something. Generic summarization smooths over exactly the details analysts care about.

The brittleness lives in the stitching between tools.

Because most of senior leadership tends to be people with a talent for selling. It’s a culture thing - they view compliance as a hurdle for salespeople to get over in order to close a deal, not a safeguard to protect their company from potential damages. 

The way I tried to overcome this in my own career was by making compliance into something that could be promoted as a potential profit center. In other words, get automations and standards so polished that we can sell compliance as a service, or use it as a competitive advantage in sales discussions.

You see a few APIs, a dashboard, and a promise that cards can go live in weeks. That surface level simplicity hides a lot of complexity underneath.

Launching a debit or prepaid card is not just a product decision. It is a regulatory and operational commitment.

One thing founders learn late is that Card as a Service is not mainly about technology. The real work happens in partnerships, approvals, and ongoing compliance. APIs help you issue cards but they do not protect you when something goes wrong.

Your issuing bank will shape your product more than most people expect. Limits, usage rules, dispute processes, and even where your cards can be used are often bank driven. If the partnership is restrictive, your roadmap becomes restrictive too. This is why understanding who owns the BIN, who holds customer funds, and how flexible the setup is really matters.

Debit and prepaid cards are not interchangeable. Prepaid programs come with caps, reload rules, and tighter controls. Debit cards require deeper integration with banking systems and stronger compliance oversight. Treating them as similar products is one of the most common early mistakes.

Compliance is not something you finish during onboarding. KYC approval is just the starting point. Transaction monitoring, chargebacks, audits, and regulatory reporting continue for as long as the program is live. Many programs get paused not because of fraud, but because of missed processes.

Card networks add another layer founders often overlook. Visa and Mastercard have their own rules and monitoring. You can be compliant with your bank and still be in violation of network requirements. When that happens, the impact is immediate and painful.

Then there is the money side. Fees add up fast. Interchange sharing, network costs, bank fees, fraud losses, and disputes all affect margins. Without clear unit economics, it is possible to grow users and still lose money on every transaction.

Ownership is another quiet issue. Who controls customer data, card inventory, approvals, and compliance relationships will decide how easy it is to raise funds or expand to new markets later. Speed to launch is tempting, but control matters more in the long run.

Most card programs do not fail because the product is bad. They fail because founders assumed someone else was handling the hard parts.

Card as a Service can be powerful when used with clarity and patience. But it works best for founders who treat it as regulated infrastructure, not a shortcut.","Everything founders should know about Card as a Service before launching debit or prepaid programs

basically if you launch a card program thinking it's just slapping an api together, you'll learn real quick that the actual work is begging your bank not to freeze everything while mastercard audits you for fun

You’re right that BIN owners and processors capture most of the *direct* issuing economics. For many programs, issuing itself is closer to a cost center than a profit engine.

Where some teams miscalculate is assuming “card issuing” *is* the product. In reality, the defensibility usually comes from what wraps around it. distribution, compliance ownership, underwriting logic, or a very specific workflow the card enables.

The CaaS saturation you mention is real. Without a clear ICP and volume anchor, like your 20,000 user corporate example, margins get crushed fast. The few programs that work long term tend to start with a non card pain point and use the card as an enabler, not the value prop.

The main platform tools developed by our team enable the following capabilities:

* analyze a single stock or an entire portfolio to see where user investments stand with an indication of the most optimal stop price
* analyze the whole portfolio's risks based on each position’s volatility
* calculate the optimal investment size 
* create a diversified portfolio from various positions
* evaluate how diversified their portfolios are across different industries and sectors within the market area
* visualize price history & other tech indicators
* create a balanced portfolio 
* search for a set of investments using specified filters
* find option trades with a good combination of risk and ROI
* test custom investing strategies
* show a calendar of past and future stock market events
* redistribute risk between existing positions in the user's investment portfolio
* provide a quick overview of the main stock markets

To keep the financial data up to date, we delivered a set of system services and console utilities that update data several times per hour on a predefined schedule. These services get updates from the data providers the solution is integrated with. We enabled the opportunity to launch them simultaneously on several servers and multi-threaded re-count of statistics and emailing. This allows for faster delivery of alerts to end users when the stock prices go up or down.

Our team integrated the customer’s ecosystem with multiple data vendors to source, obtain, and store different data types in our system, including market and descriptive data. This allowed us to form a vendor-agnostic historical market database, adding significant value to the customer’s clients.

The customer’s core platform is integrated with the following services:

* **SIX financial information** — open-high-low-close prices, corporate actions, bank ...[truncated]","Creation of the investment portfolio management ecosystem - Core platform example

Our customer is a large US-based provider of online investment and market research tools for investors and traders. The company creates products for developing equity portfolios, monitoring markets, and selling or buying at the right time.

The customer had many new ideas they wanted to bring to life, so they required a solid technological partner to realize them. They wanted to develop an investment portfolio management system with thousands of active users. The future system had to remain stable and withstand the load of a growing user base without server issues. The potential vendor would also constantly upgrade, extend, and support the product, ensuring system scalability, uninterrupted operation, high security, and 24/7 performance. 

The customer chose Itransition to develop and evolve the product due to our financial software development expertise and experience in providing dedicated teams to cover the whole range of products and services they required.

  
Core platform

The core platform is a math-based web app that allows individual investors to estimate, track, analyze, and manage their investments. The app features automated investment portfolio management, including risk management, ML-powered price and trend predictions, investment monitoring, and stock behavior analysis. Alerts for best trading strategies help investors select a proprietary trading strategy. Investment portfolios can be imported from online brokers in one click.

The platform supports almost every US brokerage and most Canadian ones, enabling users to add new brokerages as per their requests. The solution is integrated with multiple stock data service providers. This allows for intraday tracking of equities, funds, indices, and options in the US. The solution also enables users to get end-of-day data on equities in Canada, the UK, Australia, and Germany

I think the point about unclear lines is doing a lot of work here. In my experience, most of the failures were not about bad actors or bad intentions, but about ambiguity  surviving too far into production.

Once real money or shared outcomes are involved, assumptions get stress tested very quickly.

* Uses regulatory filings (e.g. SEC N-PORT)
* Computes exposures transparently
* Targets indie devs / early fintechs

I’ve been working on a project called **IOU Wallet** and it would be great to find out if you think its useful and useable. We have pushed a new release that supports

\- integrated Solana and PayPal Settlement  
\- Emoji Support for IOU creation  
\- Stability for Email verification and notification  
\- Cross Currency Support  
\- Personal IOUs for non monetary obligations

**How IOU Wallet Works**

IOU Wallet helps you keep track of everyday peer-to-peer obligations. It is designed for real-world situations where something is borrowed, a service is provided, or money is owed, and both sides want clarity without relying on formal contracts.

At its core, an IOU records who owes what to whom, under which conditions, and when the obligation is considered settled. Both parties acknowledge the IOU through a simple virtual handshake, and once settlement is confirmed a closing handshake settles the obligation.

IOU Wallet supports three types of IOUs: Items, Services, and Cash. Each can start simple and be extended with additional terms when needed.

**Item IOUs (Borrowed Things)**

**Basic example**

A friend borrows your book.  
You create an IOU that records the item. Your friend accepts it. When the book is returned, settlement is initiated and confirmed and the IOU is completed.

**With a rate**

You lend a camera for a week.  
A small daily rental rate is agreed. The rate accrues over time, starting either when the IOU is accepted or after the agreed return date.

**With redemption**

You lend equipment that may not be returned.  
Instead of returning the item, the borrower can settle the IOU by paying an agreed redemption value. If a rate applies, it is added on top of that value.

**Settlement**

Settlement can happen off-platform — for example when a book is returned, a service is completed, or cash is handed back directly.

For outstanding monetary obligations, IOU Wallet also provides on-platform I click settlement, with integrations to selected providers and support for multiple currencies. We currently Support USD, EUR, GBP and Solana. You can also settle fiat using crypto if enabled by the counterparty

**IOUs recorded through IOU Wallet are underwritten by personal integrity through virtual handshakes and are not legally enforceable**

# We are doing a soft launch and would really appreciate feedback on:

* whether the mental model makes sense
* confusing wording or flows
* edge cases you think I’ve missed

Happy to answer questions and look forward to your feedback — I hope this tool is useful for you.","IOU Wallet - keep track of what you owe and are owed through virtual handshake and integrated settlement

Today, most tools fall into one of these buckets:

	•	dashboards and categorization (what happened)

	•	static budgets or fixed rules (“always invest X%”)

	•	narrow automation that doesn’t adapt when life changes

What seems missing is a system that understands a user’s financial priorities and constraints, and reasons about tradeoffs when those priorities conflict.

The product idea I’m exploring (very early, not pitching) is a personal finance app that:

	•	connects to bank, card, and investment accounts

	•	maintains a live picture of cash flow, obligations, buffers, and goals

	•	understands what the user cares about most (liquidity, growth, near-term spending, long-term goals)

	•	evaluates decisions in that context and explains the tradeoffs

This is not about hard-coded rules like “always cut spending” or “always pause investing.”

It’s more like:

	•	“You said maintaining liquidity matters more than maximizing returns right now. Given that, here’s the safest adjustment.”

	•	“This expense is affordable, but it conflicts with the priority you set around accelerating a down payment. Here’s the impact.”

	•	“Nothing is ‘wrong,’ but something has to give. Here are the options and consequences.”

Key constraints:

	•	suggestion-based, not autonomous money movement

	•	priority-aware reasoning, not one-size-fits-all rules

	•	transparency over optimization

	•	user override on everything

I’m trying to sanity-check this with people who’ve actually built in fintech:

	•	Is modeling user priorities in a meaningful way realistic with today’s data?

	•	Does this break down more on UX/trust than on technology?

	•	Have you seen a consumer product that truly reasons about tradeoffs, not just budgets?

Also open to connecting with technical folks who:

	•	have worked with Plaid / MX / Finicity

	•	enjoy modeling state, preferences, and edge cases

	•	are skeptical of “automated finance,” but interested in better decision support

This might turn into a prototype, or it might die after some conversations. Right now I’m just trying to see if others feel this gap too.

Blunt feedback welcome.

I think you’re pointing at a real gap, but it’s less about “better reasoning” and more about *where that reasoning lives*. Most consumer apps already know *what* happened (dashboards, categories) and some know *what should happen* (rules, budgets), but they fall down when priorities shift or conflict.

In practice, the hard part isn’t modeling priorities, it’s UX plus managing tradeoffs without being rigid and  prescriptive. Users don’t want automation moving money for them; they want clarity on *what gives* when something changes, and why.

One thing we’ve seen in this space is separating concerns: aggregation + enrichment on one side, decisioning and UX on the other. The cleaner and more reliable the underlying data, the more room you have to build that “decision layer” without it feeling like a chatbot wrapper.

It can be a nightmare. most KYC automation just shifts manual review around. The real test is whether it handles messy inputs AND produces audit-grade artifacts that explain decisions later. Also helpful if they can give live feedback to your users.

After many years of gambling addiction, I finally stopped.
When the gambling stopped, I didn’t just move on. I started looking back and asking how all of this was even possible in the first place.

That’s when I began noticing how unlicensed online casinos are still operating in Germany almost without resistance.

Sites like 22Bet and 1Bet are clearly not licensed under German gambling law. No OASIS checks, no deposit limits, no proper player protection. Yet for years they have been easily accessible and fully functional.

The key issue turned out to be payments.

During the time I was gambling, Klarna Sofort was available on these sites and deposits went through smoothly. Like many people, I trusted Klarna because it’s a large, well-known payment provider operating in Germany. I assumed that if a payment option like that is available, some basic checks must have been done.

Only after I quit gambling and started looking into it more seriously did I realise that German gambling law doesn’t just prohibit illegal casinos themselves. It also prohibits payment providers from participating in payments connected to illegal gambling. Without payments, these sites simply wouldn’t survive.

That’s why I decided not to stay silent and contacted Klarna.

Over several months, I opened complaints and provided transaction histories, screenshots, and examples of unlicensed gambling sites using Klarna. Klarna confirmed to me in writing that one of their merchants had been integrated on several gambling websites and that Klarna was later removed as a payment method from those sites.

From my point of view, that confirmed that Klarna had been actively available on illegal gambling platforms, at least for a period of time.

What followed was frustrating. Despite the seriousness of the issue, my complaint never reached legal or compliance. Every response came from customer support or the complaints team. The answers were repetitive and felt almost scripted. I was repeatedly told that these merchants were considered “unsupported”, that Klarna had already taken action by removing the payment method, and that there was nothing further they could do.

The core problem was never really addressed.

Removing a payment method later does not change the fact that illegal gambling payments were previously enabled. It also doesn’t explain how this was allowed to happen in the first place, or how similar cases are being prevented now.

I’m not writing this as a legal expert or activist. I’m just someone who stopped gambling and started asking uncomfortable questions.

Quitting gambling gave me clarity. Instead of blaming myself forever, I began looking at the system around it and how easily it allows harm to happen when oversight fails.

If you’re in Germany and see familiar payment providers on online casinos, don’t automatically assume that everything is legal or properly controlled just because the brand looks trustworthy.

If others have gone through something similar or noticed the same patterns, I’d be interested to hear your thoughts.

Thanks for reading.","Klarna and Casinos

Embedded Finance sits at the center of this narrative, quietly powering payments, credit, and insurance inside everyday platforms.

Yet scale is not the same as Inclusion. Access does not automatically translate into agency. And speed does not guarantee safety.

As Embedded Finance becomes the default layer of financial interaction, it is worth asking: Are we designing systems that empower first-time users-or systems that simply extract value more efficiently?

What Embedded Finance really means in practice

Embedded Finance refers to financial services-payments, credit, insurance, investments-being built directly into non-financial platforms. A user pays, borrows, or insures without leaving the app or website they are already using.

In India, this often looks like:

A supermarket offering credit, payments, and insurance at the POS checkout
Micro-Insurance bundled into everyday transactions

Here, finance does not ask users to learn banking. It fits into existing routines. The user does not “go to a bank”- finance comes to where life already happens.

This shift is subtle—but powerful.

Why Embedded Finance matters for Financial Inclusion

Embedded Finance matters for Financial Inclusion in India because it meets people where they already are – rather than expecting them to enter traditional banking systems. Embedded Finance is not a product category. It is a design philosophy.

India’s Quiet Advantage

India is uniquely positioned to lead Embedded Finance globally- not because of fintech innovation alone, but because of its Digital Public Infrastructure. 

Digital Identity
Real-Time Payments
Open Financial Rails
Mobile-First behaviour

This allows financial services to scale without requiring users to understand finance.

Inclusion happens at the moment of need – People do not wake up wanting financial products. They want to: pay a vendor, buy inventory, handle an emergency, send money home, and automatically become part of the formal financial system.

India’s Inclusion gap is no longer about access – it is about usage, trust, fear of fraud, and lack of credit for informal workers and MSMEs.

Embedded Finance meets users in-context, increasing adoption naturally. Trust is higher in familiar platforms. For first-time or low-income users - banks feel intimidating and paperwork feels risky.

But a known platform feels safer. Embedded Finance uses existing trust which is essential for inclusion.

Inclusion with Dignity

The most important shift is not technological. It is emotional.

Embedded Finance does not label users as- “Unbanked” or “Underbanked” or “Beneficiaries.” People simply participate- on the same rails, with the same tools and through different doors. That is dignity.

Embedded Finance does not feel like Banking. And that is exactly why it works.

When Access is mistaken for Inclusion

Financial Inclusion is often measured by access: Can someone open an account? Can they transact digitally? Can they receive credit?

These are importance milestones- but they are incomplete. True Inclusion requires more:

Understanding, not just usability
Choice, not just availability
Protection, not just onboarding

In India, many first-time users encounter finance through embedded systems-without context, explanations, or alternatives. Credit appears at the moment of purchase. Insurance is bundled by default. Terms are accepted in a tap.

The result is a subtle but significant shift: People may be using financial products without fully choosing them.

Inclusion without agency risks becoming a numbers-driven exercise- one that looks successful on dashboards but leaves users bearing risks they did not consciously accept.

What Responsible Embedded Finance could look like

I do not believe Embedded Finance is inherently extractive. But it must be intentionally Inclusive, not accidentally harmful.Some principles that matter:

Visible money – Costs, interest, and consequences should be clear-designed to be understood, not just disclosed.
Moments of pause – Especially for credit. A brief interruption can protect users from long-term harm.
Right to exit – Inclusion should not trap people in systems that are easy to enter but hard to leave
Human recourse – First-time users need humans, not just algorithms, when things go wrong.
Context-aware design- Income volatility, language diversity, and social realities must be part of product decisions- not afterthoughts.

These are not constraints. They are foundations.

Real Life Use Cases of Embedded Finance, AI, and Financial Inclusion (India-focused)

For Farmers

Embedded crop loans in agri-input apps
AI predicts income based on yield and weather
Insurance auto-triggered on crop failure.

For Gig and Informal Workers

Instant credit inside delivery/ride apps
Daily repayment instead of monthly EMI’s
Embedded health and accident insurance

Grocery stores and MSME’s

Once a user signs up, teams assume that consent quietly moves with the information wherever it goes, across systems, partners, and vendors.

On the surface, that assumption feels reasonable. It only becomes a problem when someone asks you to prove it.

Fintech data is rarely static. It moves continuously between banks, payment processors, KYC providers, analytics platforms, cloud infrastructure, and internal systems, often without any single team seeing the full picture.

Each transfer introduces another layer of complexity and another opportunity for a gap to form.

Most teams rely on the belief that onboarding consent covers all of this movement. In practice, that belief tends to collapse the moment a regulator, auditor, or even a cautious partner asks a very simple question:

“Show us the consent.”

That is usually where discomfort begins. The issue is rarely that consent was never taken. The issue is that no one can clearly explain what that consent looks like today.

Who captured it? What exactly did the user agree to at that moment? Was the consent limited to a specific purpose, or was it broad enough to cover future uses? Did it explicitly allow sharing with third parties? And can that record still be retrieved years later, when memories and systems have changed?

When those questions don’t have clear answers, silence becomes expensive very quickly.

**### Consent Is Evidence, Not a Concept**

In fintech, consent is not a philosophical idea or a UX pattern. It is evidence. It is a record that must withstand audits, regulatory scrutiny, disputes, and the passage of time.

If your setup relies on implied consent, assumed consent, or vague references to “industry standards,” you are carrying far more risk than it may appear. Regulators are not interested in what felt reasonable at the time. They are interested in what can be demonstrated now.

Most consent failures are not rooted in bad technology. They stem from unclear ownership.

When multiple companies touch the same data, responsibility often slips into a grey zone. Product teams assume legal has handled it. Legal assumes the product flow captures it correctly. Vendors assume the fintech already obtained it.

When no one clearly owns consent, everyone ends up exposed. This is why explicit consent cannot be informal or implicit. It needs structure, clarity, and accountability built into the system itself.

For fintech teams, that starts with defining who is responsible for collecting consent at each stage of the data flow. It also means clearly stating what that consent covers, not only in privacy policies but in partner and vendor agreements as well.

Consent logs need to be stored, time-stamped, and retrievable long after onboarding is complete. Internal systems must align so that consent is not just captured once, but respected everywhere the data travels.

If data is shared across entities, contracts should state clearly who is responsible for responding when proof of consent is requested.

Not eventually. Not in theory. Immediately. Because in fintech, “we assumed it was covered” is not an acceptable answer.

**### Final Thoughts**

In fintech, consent is not a feeling or a checkbox. It is evidence. When consent is assumed, loosely defined, or poorly documented, it turns into a serious risk during audits and disputes.

Clear ownership, structured consent flows, and retrievable records are not optional. Consent that cannot be produced on demand might as well not exist.

In an industry where data moves fast and scrutiny is constant, the only consent that truly matters is the one you can show, clearly and confidently, when asked.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qhtul2)","Your Fintech Consent Isn't Real Without Retrievable Proof

As you all should know, customer acquisition costs for Fintech are the highest in the as-a-service industry ( currently leading at $1450 per customer on average )







This presents a massive problem. In order to scale, Fintech's require massive marketing budgets from VC Investment and dedicated SDRs costing 6 figures per year.









And even if you have 6-7 figures to burn on Paid Ads, Billboards, Publications, sales teams e.t.c. There is still no guarantee you will see the ROI necessary to meet GTV & MRR KPIs.





  


Which means that if you are bootstrapping or do not have VC backing, you're in trouble, right?





  


Well, I don't think so. There is a path of least resistance available to those willing to look outside of the industry-standard acquisition methods listed above.







The traditional point of entry to gain access to the SMB market is trust built through intensive lead nurturing, 6-12 month sales cycles, and in-person demos.





  


The primary reason these are the points of entry is that it takes months to build enough trust & authority to convince SMB founders to trust you with their books, capital, & financial infrastructure.





  


But how about if you could leverage the trust & authority of another entity that has spent years already providing a multitude of services to your ICP?









Introducing Trade Organisations. 





  


In the US alone, there are over 14,000 trade organisations representing over 20 million SMB's every year ( 66% of all SMBs are part of a trade organisation )









The GTM here is simple but lethal if implemented well. I will prove this using a real-world case study on Affiniti Finance, a US-based Fintech providing credit solutions & financial technology services to SMB's.







For context, this is a company that began operating in Q1 of 2024 ran by 2 founders in their **early 20s**. The total team size when they achieved these KPIs was **FIVE**.





  


To date, they have partnered with 17 trade organisations representing over 2 million small businesses.





  


The average business on their fintech platform generates over $4 million in annual revenue.





  


Month 1: **$200,000** in monthly GTV through their first trade organisation partnership.









Month 2: **$1.25 million** in monthly GTV through their 2nd partnership.





  


Month 3: **$3 million** in monthly GTV with the 3rd partnership.





  


Keep in mind industry leaders like Ramp and Brex took **6 MONTHS** to reach $2 million in GTV, while a pair of outside-the-box thinking founders took only 3.





  


The reason this rapid growth was possible was that they realised it would take months, if not years, to build the necessary trust & networks needed to scale GTV.









So they pivoted to using another entity's networks & existing trust instead.

The market opportunity here is so clear that I am even considering putting together a team focused on helping SMB focused Fintech's go to market via trade organizations with three main KPI's as our focus: Negative CAC, High GTVs & High User Retention.

Cheers.","Trade Organisations Are The Ultimate Growth-Hack For SMB Focused Fintech

Hello everyone, **PSA,** this post will only be relevant and useful if you are building/own a Fintech startup with SMB's as your primary ICP.







As you all should know, customer acquisition costs for Fintech are the highest in the as-a-service industry ( currently leading at $1450 per customer on average )







This presents a massive problem. In order to scale, Fintech's require massive marketing budgets from VC Investment and dedicated SDRs costing 6 figures per year.









And even if you have 6-7 figures to burn on Paid Ads, Billboards, Publications, sales teams e.t.c. There is still no guarantee you will see the ROI necessary to meet GTV & MRR KPIs.





  


Which means that if you are bootstrapping or do not have VC backing, you're in trouble, right?





  


Well, I don't think so. There is a path of least resistance available to those willing to look outside of the industry-standard acquisition methods listed above.







The traditional point of entry to gain access to the SMB market is trust built through intensive lead nurturing, 6-12 month sales cycles, and in-person demos.





  


The primary reason these are the points of entry is that it takes months to build enough trust & authority to convince SMB founders to trust you with their books, capital, & financial infrastructure.





  


But how about if you could leverage the trust & authority of another entity that has spent years already providing a multitude of services to your ICP?









Introducing Trade Organisations. 





  


In the US alone, there are over 14,000 trade organisations representing over 20 million SMB's every year ( 66% of all SMBs are part of a trade organisation )









The GTM here is simple but lethal if implemented well. I will prove this using a real-world case study on Affiniti Finance, a US-based Fintech providing credit solutions & financial technology services to SMB's.







For context, this is a company that began operating in Q1 of 2024 ran by 2 founders in their **early 20s**. The total team size when they achieved these KPIs was **FIVE**.





  


To date, they have partnered with 17 trade organisations representing over 2 million small businesses.





  


The average business on their fintech platform generates over $4 million in annual revenue.





  


Month 1: **$200,000** in monthly GTV through their first trade organisation partnership.









Month 2: **$1.25 million** in monthly GTV through their 2nd partnership.





  


Month 3: **$3 million** in monthly GTV with the 3rd partnership.





  


Keep in mind industry leaders like Ramp and Brex took **6 MONTHS** to reach $2 million in GTV, while a pair of outside-the-box thinking founders took only 3.





  


The reason this rapid growth was possible was that they realised it would take months, if not years, to build the necessary trust & networks needed to scale GTV.









So they pivoted to using another entity's networks & existing trust instead.





  


They managed to incentivize these organisations with revenue share agreements that provided them with much-needed liquidity to keep the orgs running outside of membership payments.





  


All while providing their members with access to silicon valley level technology that they would otherwise never access. 









So now, back to how this all applies to **you** as a Fintech founder.

Honestly, I’m tired of just applying online, so I started building things instead and wanted some real feedback.

One of my recent projects is a **RAG system built around the SEC EDGAR API**, where users can chat with company filings like **10-Ks, 8-Ks, and other disclosures** and get accurate, source-grounded answers. The idea was to make it easier to understand what’s actually going on inside top public companies without digging through massive documents.

It feels like there’s a huge opportunity to apply AI properly in these environments, even if they don’t actively care yet.

I also built another project around **fraud detection**, where multiple agents work together to detect and prevent suspicious payment transactions. It uses **x402-style protocols** to share signals, and about **5 agents collaborate** to analyze risk before allowing a transaction to go through.

At this point, I’m just trying to figure out:

* Am I even thinking in the right direction?
* Do these kinds of projects actually map to real-world finance problems?
* What would you improve or change if you were building this inside a bank or fintech company?

Its aimed at aspiring finance professionals that do not yet work at a big institution (retail traders, money managers, CFP's, even recent grads), but honestly anyone looking for a new take on the common economic calendar event data could also find it useful! Day traders etc.

The tool is 100% free, and there are no adds.  
  
**What the user is getting:**

* **Smart Calendar** \- Economic calendar events enhanced with institutional grade summaries on the effects of the various data prints (NFP, CPI, PPI, Jobless claims etc), bull/bear/base case scenarios planning for when the data print drops and what it means for your portfolio (screenshot below)
* **Global macro economic insights -** Institutional grade commentary on the wider market consensus in global macro
* **AI summaries of position-specific news flow** \- Nothing groundbreaking here, but helps capture the full picture of the event-to-position flow alongside wider sector or ticker specific news (this was really an afterthought, needed something for the blank sidebar)

**How it helps:**

* **Understanding the data** \- What it is, why traders care, is it inflationary or deflationary, how it affects your positions etc can be very mentally taxing, especially in the early stages of your career as a portfolio manager, market maker, analyst etc
* **Muscle memory** \- The bull/bear/base scenarios in the economic calendar event dropdown give you example scenarios for what will happen if data comes in above/below estimates, relative to a pre-defined portfolio of equities (you can change whats in there if you prefer), this helps you to think on the fly on days of many prints in a 24 hour time window
* **Faster execution** \- Analyzing events and whether or not the consensus/estimate/forecast is going to be bullish, bearish, inflationary, deflationary can take a lot of time and thinking, this helps close that gap, even for professional traders its useful as a guide

**Who it helps:**

* First year portfolio managers, analysts, traders, wealth managers etc
* Finance grads looking to get an edge in the interview process
* Finance grads looking to get an edge before starting a job on a desk, or as an analyst or portfolio manager
* Day traders, non-institutional retail traders
* Anyone interested in global macro really

  
**About the build process:**

I started with trying to build myself something that could replace the internal macro-economic commentary that I was getting at my last job of the past 10 years at a Swiss bank. This commentary and consensus came from a multitude of areas but you always had to develop your own framework for looking at things in order to decipher what that meant for your underlining positions, as well as knowing how to go about the next 10 hours of trading.   
  
Access to things like Bloomberg, Reuters, Refinitiv etc comes with a very high price tag and after being laid off I found that starting my mornings without these various ""briefs"" on market mechanics made things quite challenging. So I started building on Claude desktop for OSX using Sonnet 4.5

**Hardest part:**

* **Maintaining Context** \- getting it to understand exactly how to think and why, and get that thinking to persist across the build was quite the challenge, it seemed it needed a healthy dose of reminding however once I figures this out we start progressing quite fast, guess this is a bit of a learning curve on my side as well, ie: finding the right words to prompt it in order to elicit the correct response and not waste credits
* **Big Picture** \- Remembering to think about the bigger picture of what you are building and not get caught up in the flow of just answering claude's next question. You have to actively be thinking about whats next, why, architecture etc. For example it kept wanting to just call a web search everytime the page was reloaded to fetch the same data when I could just save that to cache or server side storage at 7 hour intervals
* **Cached Data** \- A big part of deploying new changes to production is doing QA after the fact, but I definitely underestimated how difficult proper QA can be when you are caching everything. I would deploy something and think it was good then hours later realize it wasnt, then have to peel back the layers of what caused the break. Take away on this is build a toggle into your admin suite where you can toggle off/on cached data, brings issues to light much faster
* **UI/UX** \- I found that often times the designs rendered left a bit to be desired, but what I found useful was giving some other AI's what it had created, telling them what you are building and to re-design said UI, and then compare the outputs from each, after that you just take the best parts from all and tell claude to move in that direction and Viola, better UI.

We’re conducting a research study on how MBA education is (or isn’t) keeping up with AI-driven risk management in BFSI and fintech.

AI is already shaping:

- Credit underwriting & alternative data

- Fraud detection & transaction monitoring

- Model risk management & regulatory compliance

But many MBA programs still teach risk in a largely pre-AI framework.

We’re trying to understand:

- Do students actually feel capable of applying AI to risk problems?

- What skills fintech firms expect vs what MBAs are taught

If you work in fintech, digital banking, insurtech, risk, data, or product, or you’re an MBA student/recent grad, we’d really value your input.

A former military systems integrator / program lead with real experience in regulated environments, large-scale platforms, and operational governance is currently building what is essentially Kalshi 2.0; not a clone, but a structurally improved competitor.

What stood out to me:

	•	Deep understanding of regulatory friction (not just “fintech vibes”)

	•	Experience scaling platforms inside constrained, high-trust environments

	•	Strong grasp of market mechanics, incentives, and risk

	•	Actually building teams, systems, and products and not tweeting, not pitching decks endlessly

From what I’ve seen, the thesis isn’t “prediction markets are cool.”

It’s why current platforms break under regulation, liquidity, and trust how to design around that from day one.

They’re quietly raising a small, early round from sophisticated / accredited investors who understand asymmetric bets and regulatory moats.

No hype. No public launch yet.

But if prediction markets, information arbitrage, or next-gen financial infrastructure are in your wheelhouse, this is worth a look.

Banks flag transfers from crypto wallets, apps like Revolut throttle high-volume moves during market swings, and exchanges pile on fees or delays that make daily life feel impossible. As an Eastern European freelancer who's been paid in USDT and ETH from web3 projects for the past six months, I've tested various flows to make crypto income behave like a standard bank account—with reliable SEPA transfers and a virtual card—while dodging endless compliance checks.​

The real hurdle lies in converting irregular crypto payments into usable EUR that works seamlessly with European vendors, landlords, or utility providers. Services like Wise can take two to five days for transfers and often pause larger amounts over €5,000 weekly for reviews. Revolut handles smaller transactions fine but restricts bigger ones and sometimes locks accounts tied to crypto sources. Options such as Wirex or Trastra provide partial crypto integration, yet their SEPA processing times and IBAN consistency break down with consistent use. My working routine now involves swapping incoming USDT directly into an EUR balance, which supports a personal IBAN for near-instant SEPA transfers—typically under a minute to any EU bank—and a virtual card for routine expenses from coffee to groceries. Keytom joined this process after trying alternatives, offering consistent performance with total fees around 0.7 percent and monthly limits starting at €20k that match my needs. It manages the transition without fiat custody concerns, turning weekly client payments into something as straightforward as direct deposit.

Now I handle rent in one city and shopping in another without friction, backed by clean transaction records for any oversight. No more app-switching or justifying sources to wary support.

From what I’ve seen, secure document sharing usually breaks down the moment a document leaves an internal system and gets sent externally. Inside the company, there’s structure and control, but once it’s shared out, it quickly becomes trust-based.

* user taps **“My country is not listed”**

At that point instead of letting them continue, the whole flow basically restarts and it drops back to the consent screen again.

Feels like a full reset rather than a fallback option.

Expected behavior (at least IMO) would be:

* user can still proceed
* either skip ID number
* or choose an alternate verification path

Actual behavior:

* consent screen shows again
* user thinks they got kicked out of the process

Not sure if this is intentional UX or just a side-effect of restarting the session.

* app moves to ID Number screen
* user taps **“My country is not listed”**

At that point instead of letting them continue, the whole flow basically restarts and it drops back to the consent screen again.

Feels like a full reset rather than a fallback option.

Expected behavior (at least IMO) would be:

* user can still proceed
* either skip ID number
* or choose an alternate verification path

Actual behavior:

* consent screen shows again
* user thinks they got kicked out of the process

Not sure if this is intentional UX or just a side-effect of restarting the session.

Anyone else seen this / know if this is the designed behavior?  
Trying to figure out whether I should handle this differently on our side or just explain it in UI.

The transfer failed, Wise's system said it would be refunded in 5-10 working days, but after weeks of contradictory support replies only 25 EUR was refunded. Wise now claims possible intermediary bank fees but has provided no proof or breakdown.

Wise is often recommended for international transfers because it promotes low fees, transparency, and convenience. Unfortunately, my experience so far has been quite the opposite.

In late November 2025, I initiated a 100 EUR international transfer using Wise to my wife's Tourcard account in China via the SWIFT system. We had previously been able to fund the Tourcard by credit card, but that method comes with a high \~5% commission, which becomes expensive for larger transfers. That's why we decided to try Wise instead for a relatively small amount.

The transfer was quickly marked as unsuccessful, and the funds never arrived in the Tourcard account. I initially assumed this was not a problem and simply waited for the refund, as Wise's system stated that failed transfers are returned within 5-10 working days. However, no refund arrived within that timeframe.

I then contacted Wise support. They replied that the transfer was ""completed on their end."" At the same time, Wise's own app and website continued to show the opposite status, explicitly stating that the transfer couldn't be completed and was being returned.

Because of this contradiction, I followed up multiple times and provided screenshots showing that the money was neither in my Wise balance nor credited to the recipient's Tourcard. I also contacted Shanghai Bank, which operates Tourcard. Their support was of limited help, explaining that they could not find any related transaction records. This is plausible, since Wise appears to use intermediary banks that are not transparent to the end user, and the provided UETR reference was likely only between Wise and its banking partner.

For weeks, Wise's responses consisted mostly of generic, automated email replies that didn't address the core issue and repeatedly asked for recipient bank transaction records. We even provided confirmation from the bank stating that no such transaction existed. Only by chance, during one live support chat, did an agent finally acknowledge the situation and escalate it internally.

Shortly after that, Wise marked the transfer as ""Refunded."" However, instead of returning the full amount, only 25 EUR out of the original 100 EUR was refunded.

Wise's own transfer confirmation document now shows: amount paid 100 EUR, Wise fee 5.69 EUR, status ""Refunded,"" and refunded amount 25 EUR. Wise support claims that the transfer has not yet been processed and gives a generic warning about possible ""intermediary bank fees,"" yet has not provided any breakdown, proof, or debit notes, despite repeated requests.

I waited well beyond the stated return timeframe and only raised this publicly after receiving a documented partial refund that makes no sense for a transfer that Wise itself says was never completed.

I'll update this post if the issue gets resolved, but until then, if you rely on Tourcard in China, it may honestly be safer to use different recharge methods (and before you scream just use Alipay - no, not all mini-apps will work if you don't link a domestic bank account).","Be careful with Wise when transferring to Tourcard in China

Roboadvisors are similar to buses: They take you to where you want to go (i.e. trade on your behalf), but they are designed to follow predefined routes and carry many investors together. So, they’re efficient but aren’t ideal for individualized advice.

PortfolioPilot is like Google Maps for your investments: You are still driving the car and are in full control (You execute all of your own trades), but PortfolioPilot helps you make sure that you don’t get lost along the way.



There are a few other differences to bear in mind:



1. Breadth of focus

Roboadvisors, such as Betterment and Wealthfront, focus on a specific part of your investment life, your stocks and equities portfolio. 

So, if Roboadvisors were running a Greyhound service, they would let you take a duffel bag while limiting what you can put in the bag to stocks and equities. 

PortfolioPilot instead analyzes your financial life.  So, if PortfolioPilot were Google Maps, it takes into account everything that you’ve packed into the car, including crypto, private investments, and real estate.



2. Cost

Roboadvisors usually charge you a percentage of your portfolio. That’s like weighing your bag and charging you for every extra pound. 

However, PortfolioPilot presents a fixed monthly cost regardless of how much you have packed in the car or how quickly it grows.



3. Approach

Because roboadvisors pack a lot of investors into the same vehicle, they mainly opt for the main roads, such as ETFs.

However, PortfolioPilot is designed to offer more tailored advice based on your profile and circumstances. After all, you are the only person in the car, so you can afford to take roads that might be unsuitable for others.



So, when does a Roboadvisor make sense, and when would PortfolioPilot be a better option?



There are several factors that matter here:



1. The investor’s preferences

If the investor wants to be the one driving, then PortfolioPilot might make more sense.

But if the investor wants to take a more passive role and let someone else drive the bus, then roboadvisors might be a better fit.



2. The size of the investor’s portfolio

Remember that Roboadvisors charge you based on the size of your portfolio. 

So, if you have a lot to pack into that duffel bag, then PortfolioPilot could be a more cost-effective option.

But if you are currently traveling light (maybe you are still early in your investment journey), then roboadvisors may not be as costly.



3. The different types of assets you hold

Many robo-advisors limit investors to selecting from a predefined set of stocks, ETFs, or other securities.

If those are the only assets you’re investing in today, a robo-advisor could be a practical solution.

  
All this being said, it doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing choice.

PortfolioPilot can track your roboadvisor portfolios and include them in its analysis.

So, you can use roboadvisors for your stocks and securities, and PortfolioPilot for your net worth, including the stocks and securities that you have with the roboadvisor.



The way to think about it would be as follows: 

You are still behind the wheel of your financial life. But instead of packing everything in the car, you decided to put some of it on the Greyhound just to increase your chances of achieving your financial goals.

And PortfolioPilot will track the bag in the bus as well as the car and all of its inhabitants.

But if you are investing in various asset classes, e.g. real estate, art pieces, and crypto, then PortfolioPilot would make it easy to track all of those assets simultaneously.

Anyone else feel like crypto is oddly… calm?

No crazy hype.  
No nonstop moon tweets.  
No “this will replace everything by next year” energy.

But after reading today’s crypto news, I don’t think that’s a bad sign.

It feels like crypto is growing up.

A few things I noticed 

**Regulation isn’t the villain anymore.**  
Yeah, rules are annoying. Always have been.  
But what’s happening now feels different. Stablecoins are being forced to actually prove they’re stable. Shady stuff is getting filtered out. The serious players are still standing.

**Institutions didn’t rage quit. They just went quiet.**  
Banks and funds aren’t yelling on Twitter.  
They’re building in the background tokenized funds, custody, onchain settlement, even using Bitcoin as collateral instead of trying to buy coffee with it.

That kind of adoption is boring… until it isn’t.

**DeFi isn’t dead. It’s just less loud.**  
The wild yield farms are fading, but what’s replacing them feels more real:  
KYC pools. Real world assets. Stuff that can actually plug into the financial system without blowing up.

Not exciting screenshots. Just foundations.

**The tech conversation changed.**  
It’s not “which chain is fastest” anymore.  
It’s “does this work reliably, cheaply, and at scale?”

Layer 2s. Interoperability. Boring problems that actually matter.

Anyone else feel like crypto is oddly… calm?

No crazy hype.  
No nonstop moon tweets.  
No “this will replace everything by next year” energy.

But after reading today’s crypto news, I don’t think that’s a bad sign.

It feels like crypto is growing up.

A few things I noticed 

**Regulation isn’t the villain anymore.**  
Yeah, rules are annoying. Always have been.  
But what’s happening now feels different. Stablecoins are being forced to actually prove they’re stable. Shady stuff is getting filtered out. The serious players are still standing.

**Institutions didn’t rage quit. They just went quiet.**  
Banks and funds aren’t yelling on Twitter.  
They’re building in the background tokenized funds, custody, onchain settlement, even using Bitcoin as collateral instead of trying to buy coffee with it.

That kind of adoption is boring… until it isn’t.

**DeFi isn’t dead. It’s just less loud.**  
The wild yield farms are fading, but what’s replacing them feels more real:  
KYC pools. Real world assets. Stuff that can actually plug into the financial system without blowing up.

Not exciting screenshots. Just foundations.

**The tech conversation changed.**  
It’s not “which chain is fastest” anymore.  
It’s “does this work reliably, cheaply, and at scale?”

Layer 2s. Interoperability. Boring problems that actually matter.

**Security is finally taken seriously.**  
Audits, monitoring, certifications used to be “nice to have.”

I keep seeing founders talk about product, growth, partnerships, UX.

But the thing that’s actually killing or saving fintechs in **2026** doesn’t get talked about enough.

Compliance.

Not in the “yeah yeah we’ll handle it later” sense.  
In the “your bank won’t even talk to you” sense.

What I’m seeing around me:

* Payment processors getting hit with ongoing audits, not once-a-year checks
* Teams scrambling because PCI DSS v4.0 is suddenly enforced, not theoretical
* Launches delayed for months because licenses take way longer than the pitch decks assumed
* Crypto startups realizing they’re being treated like real financial institutions now

And here’s the part that surprised me most:

Compliance isn’t something you finish anymore.  
It’s something that quietly decides:

* whether you get banking access
* whether your payment rails stay open
* whether enterprise customers trust you
* whether investors believe your revenue won’t disappear overnight

The fintechs doing well right now aren’t the flashiest ones.  
They’re the ones that built compliance into the product early, even when it felt boring and expensive.

Kind of wild how the thing everyone tried to postpone is now the thing deciding who gets to exist.

Curious if others are seeing the same:  
Are you designing compliance into your stack from day one, or still trying to bolt it on later?

Would love to hear real experiences.","Anyone else notice that “compliance” is now what actually decides if a fintech launches or dies? (2026)

Then Fintech contracts must define the testing-to-live switch,"Sandbox access feels safe, and in many ways it is meant to be. Most fintech teams start here for good reason. You are working with dummy data, controlled traffic, relaxed thresholds, and limited exposure. In that environment, systems behave predictably, integrations follow expected paths, and mistakes feel contained rather than costly.

Everything about the sandbox is designed to create confidence. And for early development and testing, that confidence is useful.

The problem begins when confidence quietly turns into assumption.

After spending enough time in a stable sandbox environment, it becomes easy to believe that production will simply be the same system operating at a larger scale. If APIs respond correctly, transactions settle cleanly, and edge cases appear manageable in testing, the leap to production feels incremental rather than fundamental.

That belief feels logical, but it is also where risk starts to hide. Sandbox success does not translate cleanly into production readiness, because the two environments do not just differ in volume. They operate under entirely different expectations.

In production, transaction patterns are uneven and unpredictable. Systems are stressed continuously rather than in controlled bursts. Banks begin monitoring behaviour, not just validating test calls. Regulators expect logs, explanations, and timelines the moment something looks irregular.

At that point, incidents stop being learning exercises. They become reportable events with legal, operational, and reputational consequences.

**### Where Contracts Go Quiet**

Despite these differences, many fintech contracts never clearly separate testing from live operations. Sandbox access is granted, integrations are built, and time passes without anyone defining when responsibility actually changes.

Over time, expectations blur. Providers are asked to deliver production-grade uptime while still operating under sandbox pricing and informal timelines. Compliance obligations creep in gradually, even though no one agreed on when regulatory duties would begin.

Risk teams start asking questions that the technical setup was never designed to answer. Engineering teams feel the pressure, but there is nothing in writing to anchor the conversation.

No one is acting unreasonably. They are simply relying on assumptions that were never aligned.

Sandbox access should never be treated as a preview of production. It is a separate phase with a different purpose, a different risk profile, and different expectations.

When this distinction is not documented, teams drift into production obligations without production readiness. That drift is slow and subtle, which is why it is so dangerous. By the time the mismatch becomes obvious, exposure has already been created.

This is how avoidable disputes and regulatory issues begin, not through negligence, but through silence.

**### What Needs to Be Explicit From the Start**

If you are building or integrating fintech systems, certain boundaries need to be written down clearly.

Start by defining what sandbox access allows, and just as importantly, what it does not. Make it explicit that performance guarantees, uptime commitments, and regulatory reporting obligations do not apply during testing.

Then define the trigger for production in precise terms. This could be a formal certification, a written go-live approval, or a successful pilot capped at specific transaction volumes. What matters is that the transition is intentional and documented, not implied.

Once production begins, responsibility changes in real and immediate ways. Contracts should reflect that shift clearly.

Document who monitors incidents, who reports to regulators, what timelines apply, and what data must be retained. Be explicit about who bears the cost when failures occur under real-world conditions, because those costs look very different after go-live.

Finally, put a basic risk management process in place before the first live transaction runs. Escalation paths, incident classification, and communication protocols do not need to be complex, but they need to exist in advance.

**### Final Thoughts**

Sandbox environments reduce risk, but they do not reflect production reality. When contracts fail to draw a clear line between testing and live operations, production expectations quietly attach themselves to sandbox arrangements.

Clear triggers, defined responsibilities, and documented risk shifts prevent teams from operating under obligations they never agreed to.

Sandbox access is meant to limit exposure, not disguise it. If you do not define the moment testing ends and real responsibility begins, someone else will define it for you later. And by then, you may already be operating under rules you never consciously accepted.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1pz6nev)","Sandbox safe?

**Trastra**  
More card-led in its design. Conversion to a EUR IBAN paired with a Visa card usable online, in-store, and at ATMs (Apple Pay supported). UX mirrors traditional debit products, which lowers the learning curve. However, fixed fees on SEPA transfers, FX, and ATM usage can make cost modeling less favorable for high-frequency or low-ticket transactions.

**Product takeaway**

Regarding programming, I'm very drawn to creating technologies, applications, or programs, but I have almost no experience in that area, and I've never been very logical or technical. In fact, I lean more towards the creative side, and I'm aware that this type of engineering is more mathematical or technical, but I think I'm motivated by the idea of ​​learning something completely new and combining both the technical and creative aspects to create something more innovative, or combining my interest in finance and programming to specialize in Fintech. Additionally, I'd like to gain experience working remotely (and be able to travel while working), but I don't just want to work as a freelancer; I'd also like to lead a team or a project.

Furthermore, I highly value soft skills and believe they are essential in any career. I really enjoy sales and entrepreneurship, and I'd like to start or integrate businesses in the future. I consider myself a sociable person and would like to improve my public speaking and negotiation skills.

So, choosing a career that complements my vision and the skills I want to learn (IT, Finance, and Business) is proving difficult. I was considering a solid foundation in technology (Engineering) and taking courses or certifications in other areas (Fintech or Business), but I've realized that many people know how to program and create things without a university degree. I'd also like to gain work experience in the tech field, and I'm not sure how necessary a degree is. I know people who didn't learn at university, and they say there's a lot of filler there, and it's very complicated, only to end up still being a junior and having to take courses elsewhere.

My other option is a degree in Finance (focused on technology especially), like Quantitative Finance or something related. But many people think you can learn Finance with just a master's degree or certificates, so I don't know if a full degree is worth it, especially considering that traditional Finance is becoming almost obsolete. If I do pursue this degree, I'd like to take separate programming courses (and try to reach a senior level), but I don't know how effective that would be without a degree.

I need your help, please.","Software Engineering (or similar) or Finance?

Furthermore, I highly value soft skills and believe they are essential in any career. I really enjoy sales and entrepreneurship, and I'd like to start or integrate businesses in the future. I consider myself a sociable person and would like to improve my public speaking and negotiation skills.

So, choosing a career that complements my vision and the skills I want to learn (IT, Finance, and Business) is proving difficult. I was considering a solid foundation in technology (Engineering) and taking courses or certifications in other areas (Fintech or Business), but I've realized that many people know how to program and create things without a university degree. I'd also like to gain work experience in the tech field, and I'm not sure how necessary a degree is. I know people who didn't learn at university, and they say there's a lot of filler there, and it's very complicated, only to end up still being a junior and having to take courses elsewhere.

My other option is a degree in Finance (focused on technology especially), like Quantitative Finance or something related. But many people think you can learn Finance with just a master's degree or certificates, so I don't know if a full degree is worth it, especially considering that traditional Finance is becoming almost obsolete. If I do pursue this degree, I'd like to take separate programming courses (and try to reach a senior level), but I don't know how effective that would be without a degree.

How many of you here are genuinely active investors right now? Not just reading headlines or watching YouTube, but actually putting money to work every month.

Because this is the weird part about investing in India today. Information is not scarce anymore. It’s overflowing. Every app has “top picks”, every platform has research notes, every influencer has a list.

But when you’re the one investing your own money, the real problem isn’t “can I find stock ideas?”

It’s this:

You can realistically act on maybe 2 or 3.  
And you still don’t know which ones are right for you.

Most of us are not from a finance background. We have jobs, lives, and limited time. We want to invest regularly and sensibly, but we end up stuck between two extremes.

One extreme is blindly following generic recommendations.  
The other is analysis paralysis because everything sounds reasonable.

It’s an early stage platform designed to help Indian retail investors make decisions that are actually aligned to them, not just a generic research list that looks impressive on paper.

As I think about building, I've recently deep dived into the possibilities in Canada.

**There are no variable cost BaaS fullstack support options in Canada for card issuance. Alternatively, U.S. has this:**

Seems the biggest barrier to these solutions is the closed nature of infrastructure support. For example, limited bank sponsors (DC, peoples), that operate on a fixed cost support model (i.e., need to pay monthlys and upfront costs)

Alternatively, in the U.S. Lithic (payments BaaS infra for B2C/B2B) and Stripe (B2B)... etc middleware solutions that lower the barriers to entry and charge a variable cost per account/interchange/etc...

Find it hard to think about challenging the consolidated big 5 when new companies can't issue cards easily. Is there any ways to manage this?

Traditionally, the best businesses get traction/validation and then scale accordingly vs. here, a company would need to take upfront risk, making entering much less attractive. When can we/can we expect Canada to expand into more variable cost startup options?

**Lacking information availability for regulatory and operational clarity:**

What are the implications of RPAA? If a PSP registers for RPAA + as a MSB through FINTRAC, when/why would there need to be an incremental step for full bank sponsorship? For example, could a fintech hold deposits at a bank without necessarily being ""sponsored"" by them + use middleware/BaaS providers for KYC/AML only, instead of fullstack including bank sponsorship (would this lower the risk/cost for these middleware and enable lower b2e in any way)

**Overall, the regulatory landscape seems very confusing, almost fragmented, and very very against fintechs... my main assumption is much of this is unnecessary (even if debit interchange is lower...etc, surely there are other middleware pricing methods) as it seems other countries have it easier.**

The output passes the eye test without much effort and this can be replicated in many areas (refund scams with AI-generated “damaged goods” photos, synthetic identities onboarding with generated documents, impersonations that look identical to the real person).

I keep going back and forth on whether this is a solvable technical problem or if we're just watching the entire premise of visual verification collapse in slow motion.

Sharing technical lessons here in case it helps others building in regulated or bank-connected systems.  
  
This is not a product launch — just engineering takeaways.  
  
  
1. **“Connect your bank” is a state machine, not a flow**  
On paper, the flow looks linear:  
  
create user → redirect → consent → callback → fetch accounts  
In reality, it’s a distributed state machine with failure points at every step:  


redirect interrupted  
browser refresh mid-consent  
user abandons flow  
provider sends callback but session is gone

  
**Lesson:**  
Persist every step server-side. Never rely on client memory or URL params as truth.  
  
  
2. **Redirects will break your auth assumptions**  
If your app uses:  
  
cookies  
short-lived sessions  
client-side auth state  
…redirect-based consent flows will expose the cracks.  
  
I had to explicitly design for:  
  
rehydrating user identity after returning  
correlating callbacks to users safely  
handling “valid callback, missing app session”

  
**Lesson:**  
Treat redirect returns as untrusted entry points. Re-verify everything.  
  
  
3. **Sandbox ≠ Production behavior**  
Sandbox is helpful, but:  
  
account availability differs  
error timing differs  
edge cases are fewer  
Some flows that were “clean” in sandbox needed defensive handling for production-like behavior.  
  
**Lesson:**  
Design error handling early. Assume production banks will behave inconsistently.  
  
  
4. **Consent scopes drive everything downstream**  
The data you think you’ll get depends heavily on:  
  
selected scopes  
bank-specific consent interpretation  
regional constraints  
A missing scope doesn’t fail loudly — it fails quietly (empty data, partial data).  
  
**Lesson:**  
Validate consent scopes explicitly and fail early if expectations aren’t met.  
  
  
5. **Logging is more important than UI at first**  
Early on, most progress came from:  
  
detailed server logs  
correlation IDs  
timestamped transitions  
UI mattered far less than being able to explain what happened when something went wrong.  
  
**Lesson:**  
Build observability before polish.  
  
  
6. T**he integration is not “done” when it works once**  
A successful happy-path run is maybe 30% of the work.  
  
The real work is:  
  
retries  
idempotency  
re-consent flows  
reconnecting broken accounts gracefully

  
**Lesson:**  
Treat bank integrations as long-lived relationships, not setup tasks.  
  
  
**Final thought**  
What users experience as:  
  
“Connect your bank account”  
…represents weeks of careful engineering, defensive design, and humility in the face of real-world financial systems.

PSD2 was supposed to make things better. Instead, it mostly improved life for a tiny B2B niche.

* registering phones (and even browsers)
* questionable PIN usage
* captchas

* an API to at least read (!) my transactions and financial status
* webhooks to integrate with other tools

most fraud systems I've seen work like this: security team builds something ""robust"" and ""aggressive,"" ships it, moves on. then six months later product is scrambling because trust metrics are tanking and support tickets are through the roof.

the problem isn't that these systems fail to catch fraud. it's that they flag too many legitimate people in the crossfire. every false positive is a blocked transaction. every blocked transaction is a ""yes, that really was me"" message. every one of those is a customer doing work your system should've handled on its own.

Barclays apparently flipped the whole approach. instead of optimizing for security first and smoothing friction later, they designed for customer experience from the start and built security into that foundation.

three things stood out: their ML engine thinks in milliseconds but behaves more like a human analyst. they run continuous feedback loops - model retraining, testing, error audits - so the system doesn't drift over time. And when they do block a transaction, they actually explain why. not ""suspicious activity detected"" but ""this differs from your normal spending pattern because X, Y, Z.""

that last part is what got me. most systems just block you and make you prove yourself. Barclays tells you the reasoning. seems small but I think that's actually the difference between a customer who shrugs it off and one who starts looking for a new bank.

most fintechs treat fraud as a backend compliance function. Barclays treated it as a customer experience problem that happens to involve security.

do you think this approach actually scales or is it one of those things that only works when you have Barclays-level resources?

On the surface they look almost identical: crypto and fiat balances, named IBAN, SEPA transfers, internal transfers, basic swaps. In practice they solve slightly different problems.

# Quppy: neobank with crypto on top

Quppy is the more familiar name. You get multi‑currency accounts, crypto wallets, a named IBAN and simple swaps. There’s no monthly maintenance fee, SEPA in/out is free, and card fees are fairly standard, so it works well if your usage pattern is:

* receive EUR once in a while
* convert a portion into crypto
* occasionally send a SEPA transfer or pay by card

The product feels very “neobank‑first”: solid for basic banking plus light crypto, but there’s not much focus on more complex crypto‑to‑fiat flows (no mass payouts in crypto, no tooling for larger recurring off‑ramp, etc.). If your requirement is basically “have an EU IBAN that is not allergic to crypto”, Quppy is good enough.

# Keytom: geared more towards active crypto–fiat flows

Keytom feels more interesting if you regularly move value between crypto and fiat rather than just hold a bit of BTC on the side.

The setup looks like this:

* KYC → personal EUR account with named IBAN
* a set of crypto accounts (coins + stables)
* swaps, on‑ and off‑ramp, payouts to third‑party banks and transfers to exchanges exposed as core flows in the UI

What stood out to me:

* fees are shown per transaction before you confirm (both for swaps and transfers), which is useful if you care about effective FX/spread;
* the app is clearly designed around repeated crypto→EUR→payout scenarios rather than occasional “one‑off” swaps;
* there’s a referral bonus for early users, but it’s more of a nice‑to‑have than the main reason to use it.

It’s not trying to be a trading app; it’s closer to “payments and settlements layer that happens to speak both fiat and crypto”.

# When does each one make sense?

Roughly how it looks from my side:

* If you want a low‑maintenance EU IBAN, free SEPA and the option to hold some coins without going too deep into crypto flows, Quppy is fine.
* If a noticeable part of your balance lives in crypto and you routinely need to turn it into something spendable (EUR payouts, bank transfers, card spend), Keytom currently feels more aligned with that use case.

I’m still running both in parallel to see how they behave over time (support, edge cases, larger amounts).

I’m exploring a research project around how financial organizations reason about *why* things go wrong, and I’m trying to learn directly from people in the field. Specifically, I’m interested in areas where **qualitative narratives** matter more than numbers — things like incident reports, post-mortems, compliance reviews, regulatory responses, internal investigations, or governance discussions.

For example, I’ve been looking at public enforcement and incident reports where organizations describe what happened, who knew what, and which controls failed. The narratives often explain events clearly, but it’s much harder to see how incentives, communication gaps, and process decisions interacted over time — especially when comparing multiple cases.

  
A few questions I’d love your perspective on:

* In your role, where do qualitative narratives actually influence decisions the most?
* When something fails (process breakdown, compliance issue, operational incident), how do teams reason about *cause* vs just documenting what happened?
* What’s hard or frustrating about the current approach? (e.g., slow reviews, subjective judgment, inconsistent conclusions, hard-to-defend explanations)
* Are there decisions where you wish you had clearer causal structure across cases, but today rely on manual review, consultants, or “best judgment”?

I’ve worked with several small businesses using ACH debit that kept running into issues not due to fraud, but because of closed accounts, repeated NSF returns, and basic bank detail errors.

In a few cases, those return patterns triggered additional scrutiny and eventually led to their ACH programs being paused. The frustrating part was that most of these failures could have been avoided.

ACH is a delicate platform, and small mistakes tend to add up quickly.

After seeing this happen repeatedly, we shifted our approach toward **verifying bank details before submitting ACH or eCheck transactions,** including routing number validity, whether an account is open, and basic balance or risk signals. Taking this step noticeably improved return rates.

This doesn’t eliminate all returns; ACH never will, especially in fraud-related cases, but it does help catch obvious issues early and keeps ACH programs healthier overall.

In practice, teams use it to build workflows that take in messy borrower data like bank statements, PDFs, financials and forms, extract and standardise that data, run checks and logic, and push a clean credit decision downstream. It replaces a lot of manual operations, spreadsheets, and internal back and forth.



Here is where we are getting stuck. How do you design the trial?



This is not a product where value shows up by clicking around a dashboard. Lenders only really get it once they upload real borrower data, build an actual workflow, and see the system do the heavy lifting. The moment that happens, we incur real processing costs.



Our current thinking is to let users sign up and give them a fixed amount of processing capacity, roughly 100 dollars worth. There is no countdown timer. No artificial walls. They can build real workflows and process real credit applications until that capacity runs out.



Internally, the debate is whether this is smart or naive.



On one hand, removing time pressure feels right. Lenders move slowly. Credit processes take time. A 7 or 14 day trial might just guarantee they never reach the aha moment.



On the other hand, unlimited time with all features unlocked might reduce urgency. Worse, it could turn the product into a free processing tool for teams that never intend to pay.



We have discussed time boxed trials, feature limited trials, and hybrid approaches. Most of them feel like they optimise for our risk rather than the user reaching real value.

I am in a great but tough spot, I have received two attractive offers from high-growth FinTech companies and I’m looking for some external insight, particularly on long-term equity potential and internal culture. I've decided to move forward with one, but would love to know if I'm making the right call from a valuation/scaling perspective. 

The two options were: 

1. Wiz (Cloud Security):Offer was for a GRC/Audit role, potentially based fully remote from The Netherlands. Wiz is a known hyper-growth Decacorn ($10B+ valuation). 

2. \*\*BVNK (Stablecoin Payments/InfraSec):Offer is for an Information Security/Operational Risk role, based fully remote from Spain. BVNK is a fast-growing scale-up with a recent valuation around $750M. 



My Question to the Community: Both offers were excellent from a salary standpoint, but I'm trying to gauge which one provides a better long-term equity opportunity for the stock options. 

1. Equity Potential: Based on their market (Cloud Security vs. Stablecoin Payments Infrastructure) but also the context with the buy out from Google for Wiz and the potential buy out from Mastercard for BVNK, which company do you think has the best odds of a massive scale-up in the next 3-5 years? Where is the equity most likely to ""hit""? 

2. Internal Feedback:Does anyone have current or past internal feedback (on either Wiz or BVNK) regarding culture, burnout, or how the company leadership is perceived by those holding options? 

3. Liquidity:If you had to bet, which company provides the most realistic chance of a liquidity event (like a secondary sale or IPO) sooner? Any insight would be super valuable in validating my final decision!

I am in a great but tough spot, I have received two attractive offers from high-growth FinTech companies and I’m looking for some external insight, particularly on long-term equity potential and internal culture. I've decided to move forward with one, but would love to know if I'm making the right call from a valuation/scaling perspective. 

The two options were: 

1. Wiz (Cloud Security):Offer was for a GRC/Audit role, potentially based fully remote from The Netherlands. Wiz is a known hyper-growth Decacorn ($10B+ valuation). 

2. \*\*BVNK (Stablecoin Payments/InfraSec):Offer is for an Information Security/Operational Risk role, based fully remote from Spain. BVNK is a fast-growing scale-up with a recent valuation around $750M. 



My Question to the Community: Both offers were excellent from a salary standpoint, but I'm trying to gauge which one provides a better long-term equity opportunity for the stock options. 

1. Equity Potential: Based on their market (Cloud Security vs. Stablecoin Payments Infrastructure) but also the context with the buy out from Google for Wiz and the potential buy out from Mastercard for BVNK, which company do you think has the best odds of a massive scale-up in the next 3-5 years? Where is the equity most likely to ""hit""? 

2. Internal Feedback:Does anyone have current or past internal feedback (on either Wiz or BVNK) regarding culture, burnout, or how the company leadership is perceived by those holding options? 

3. Liquidity:If you had to bet, which company provides the most realistic chance of a liquidity event (like a secondary sale or IPO) sooner? Any insight would be super valuable in validating my final decision! 

  
PS : if you want to add any comments feel free :)

For nearly a decade, inclusion efforts focused on expanding access — opening bank accounts, issuing debit cards, and onboarding users to digital payments. But this year signaled a more profound shift: from access to meaningful usage, from infrastructure to outcomes, and from transactions to trust. India’s Financial Inclusion Index touched 67.0, its highest so far, reflecting improvements across Access, Usage, and Quality. This rise is not just a statistical jump; it represents a behavioral and systemic shift. More people are saving, transacting digitally, accessing credit, and engaging with insurance and pension products than ever before.

The Digital Engine Behind Inclusion. The real catalyst of 2025 has been India’s maturing digital public infrastructure. The JAM trinity—Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile— continues to anchor the ecosystem, but it is UPI that has become the country’s most powerful inclusion engine. What began as a payments innovation is now a complete financial access platform: 
•Credit-on-UPI for small borrowers and merchants
 •UPI QR penetration even in remote areas 
•High adoption among women, micro-entrepreneurs, and gig workers
 •A dramatic rise in rural digital transactions. For many first-time users, UPI wasn’t just a payment feature—it became their first experience of seamless, reliable formal finance.

Women, Micro-Entrepreneurs, and Rural Users Lead the Shift. A quiet but powerful trend in 2025 was the growing participation of women in the financial system. More than half of all Jan Dhan accounts are held by women, strengthening economic agency at the household level. Rural users also displayed rising comfort with digital transactions, partly driven by:
 •Last-mile banking through BC networks
 •Micro-ATMs and Digital Banking Units 
•DBT transfers that improved account activity
 •Local merchants adopting QR payments. 
Financial inclusion is no longer urban-led; it is now a Bharat story.

Policy Reset: NSFI 2025–2030 The launch of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2025–2030 was one of the year’s defining policy moments. The strategy clearly shifts India’s goalposts: from bringing people into the system to helping them benefit from it. Key focus areas include: 
•Deepening financial literacy 
•Improving grievance redressal and consumer protection
 •Expanding credit access for MSMEs and households
 •Leveraging digital innovations safely
 •Strengthening trust in the financial system. 
This emphasis on quality of inclusion aligns India with global best practices.

Fintech’s Expanding Role 2025 was also the year fintech innovation matured in the service of inclusion rather than solely for scale.
 •Alternative credit scoring helped thin-file borrowers get their first loans
 •Gig workers and micro-merchants accessed small-ticket credit
 •Insurtech platforms drove micro-insurance adoption
 •Wealth-tech apps simplified small savings and SIPs for first-time investors
 •Payments Banks and SFBs expanded access in underserved regions

Fintech is no longer just about convenience; it is about access, trust, and affordability.

Beyond Access: The Transition to Real Financial Empowerment While numbers look promising, the most crucial shift is qualitative:
 •More accounts are active
 •More transactions are meaningful
 •More users are comfortable navigating digital finance
 •More households are building safety nets through insurance and savings
 •More micro-entrepreneurs are accessing credit without collateral Financial inclusion in 2025 is not about how many people are “in the system.” It is about how confidently people use the system to meet everyday needs, manage risks, and invest in opportunities.

The Road Ahead Despite progress, challenges remain:
 •Digital literacy gaps in rural and low-income communities
 •Rising online fraud risks
 •Limited access to affordable formal credit
 •Low penetration of pensions and insurance in large informal segments. 

But 2025 has laid a strong foundation for what comes next. If the momentum continues, India may well become a global case study in how technology, policy, and grassroots behaviour change can together create a financially resilient population.

Closing Thoughts: 2025 reset India’s financial inclusion narrative. It showed that real empowerment doesn’t come from opening a bank account — it comes from the confidence to use economic tools to secure one’s future.
The next decade will determine whether India can turn broad access into deep financial well-being. If current trends continue, the answer could very well be yes.","Financial Inclusion in India : A 2025 Reset

Founders push new ideas quickly, roll out beta versions without hesitation, and treat every early launch as something they can refine later. The internal belief becomes something along the lines of: if it breaks, it breaks, users know it is unfinished, and once the real release arrives everything will settle down again.



The problem is that the world outside the product team does not see it that way. Users rarely differentiate between alpha, beta, preview, or experimental builds; they simply see the product they are interacting with, and that product represents a company’s reliability. When something fails, users do not blame a label; they blame the company behind the product, because that is the entity they believe made a promise to them.



Regulators treat it even more plainly. In the eyes of the law, a beta environment is still an operational stage, which means it continues to carry obligations. The beta tag may help communicate uncertainty internally, but it does not reduce responsibility externally. Beta is not a safe zone; it is a risk stage that requires boundaries.



**### Where SaaS Teams Get Beta Wrong**



Most teams treat beta as a space where usual rules do not apply, but beta actually increases the number of unknowns. More unknowns naturally increase risk, which means clarity matters more at this stage rather than less. If expectations are not written down, users assume the same level of uptime, performance, and reliability they experience in the main product.



The moment assumptions form, expectations start shifting silently in the background, and that is where disputes come from. The straightforward way to avoid this is to set rules before the first build is released.



**### Protecting Your SaaS Product Without Slowing Innovation**



You do not need to slow innovation in order to reduce operational or legal exposure, but you do need clear boundaries that are visible before users try the feature. The right communication protects both sides and lets teams continue to move fast without creating unnecessary risk.



1. Define what beta will not guarantee



This is something that must be written into contracts, onboarding flow, or product documentation. Users should know that beta environments have reduced promises and limited reliability. Make it clear that beta does not guarantee uptime, performance, integration stability, or typical SLA coverage. People are not frustrated by limited promises; they are frustrated by unclear promises.



2. Explain what data will be collected



Beta releases are meant to produce learning, and you cannot learn without data. But transparency matters if you are going to collect logs, behavioural information, or error traces. Users should know what data you collect, why you need it, and how it will be used. Clear communication builds trust rather than eroding it.



3. Restrict where beta can be used



Every beta release should have a controlled boundary. It should not sit inside a mission-critical operation, sensitive workflow, or any regulated industry such as fintech or healthcare. A simple use restriction prevents failures in places where a failure could have compounding consequences.



4. Include an exit right to shut the beta down



At some point, every SaaS company has to withdraw a feature quickly. If the contract does not allow the company to shut down a beta build without friction, it can get locked into supporting something it no longer believes in. An exit clause makes it possible to end a beta stage immediately if a risk appears.



**### Beta Should Feel Exciting, Not Hazardous**



Most users enjoy early access to new features, but they only enjoy it when the rules are visible. When expectations are not defined, the risks start appearing in the form of misunderstandings, instability, or misplaced reliance. Beta is a test environment, but it involves real users, real data, and real obligations, which is why boundaries matter.



When those boundaries are clear and communicated early, innovation becomes faster because there is less uncertainty around what the company owes at each stage. In SaaS, clarity is not bureaucracy; it is operational velocity. The slowdowns happen when misunderstandings surface and create expensive friction that was avoidable.



The beta label does not change legal responsibility. Users still expect reliability, and regulators view beta as another operational environment with obligations. That means risk actually increases, which is why boundaries need to be clearer, not looser. By defining what is not guaranteed, what data will be collected, where beta can be used, and your right to shut it down, you create a safer and more predictable path for experimentation.

Most underwriting tools today are either fully manual (slow + inconsistent) or fully automated (zero transparency). Both fail to capture what actually makes a great underwriter: experience, intuition, and qualitative judgment.

I’ve been building something different: an AI Copilot that augments underwriters instead of replacing them.

What it does:
Company Research → pulls financial, industry, governance, and news signals into one clean view
Risk Evaluation → analyses key underwriting metrics with full explainability
CAM Drafting → generates a transparent memo that the underwriter can edit, question, or override

Why it matters:
Underwriters stay in control.
No black-box outputs.
No rigid templates.
Just faster, deeper, more consistent decisions, with human insight at the centre.

For several years I saw Klarna’s payment option appear on gambling websites that don’t have the required licensing in Germany. These kinds of operators should be blocked by any regulated payment provider. Instead the payments went through again and again.

I collected all the evidence and reported it directly to Klarna. I expected a fast and serious reaction, but their response was slow and didn’t match how big this issue actually is. It feels like their merchant monitoring and risk systems failed completely.

I’m posting this here because I’m wondering if anyone in fintech has seen similar problems with Klarna or other payment providers when it comes to high risk or gambling-related merchants. To me this looks like a much larger compliance gap, not just one isolated mistake.

Stablecoins, acting as digital bridges between traditional finance and blockchain, have emerged as a compelling solution. The question for FinTech professionals is: are they an overhyped novelty or the inevitable future infrastructure?

# Defining the Present Context of Stablecoin Remittance

**Stable Coins** are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US Dollar (e.g., USDT, USDC). This fiat-peg is critical, eliminating the volatility that makes assets like Bitcoin unsuitable for day-to-day transfers and payroll.

In the remittance space, stablecoins are primarily used in a ""stablecoin sandwich"" model: fiat is converted to a stablecoin (on-ramp), the stablecoin is instantly transferred across borders via blockchain, and then converted back to the recipient's local fiat currency (off-ramp).

The current remittance system relies on the decades-old correspondent banking network (SWIFT), which involves multiple intermediaries, pre-funding of nostro/vostro accounts, and batch-settlement windows. This friction results in the global average cost for sending a $200 remittance still exceeding **6.6%**, according to recent reports.

# The Clear Advantages: Speed and Cost

The value proposition of stablecoins is straightforward and impactful:

* **Near-Instant Settlement:** Traditional transfers can take 1–5 business days. Stablecoin transactions on high-throughput blockchains (like Solana, Stellar, or Polygon) can settle in **minutes**, sometimes even seconds, operating 24/7/365.
* **Drastic Cost Reduction:** By eliminating correspondent bank intermediaries, the marginal cost of a stablecoin transfer can be reduced to fractions of a penny. Even with on/off-ramp and FX fees factored in, total remittance costs can drop significantly. Some operators have demonstrated costs well under 1%, compared to the 6.6% global average.
* **Liquidity and Capital Efficiency:** For payment providers, stablecoins enable real-time liquidity management, freeing up capital currently locked in pre-funded accounts across various jurisdictions, a crucial efficiency gain for institutional players.

# Flaws and Operational Hurdles

Despite the clear technical superiority, widespread adoption faces significant friction points:

1. **Regulatory Uncertainty:** This remains the primary hurdle. Regulations vary wildly across jurisdictions. The lack of a unified global framework creates a complex legal patchwork, forcing providers to limit services or build costly, bespoke compliance systems. While initiatives like the EU’s MiCA and US-based proposals (like the GENIUS Act) are emerging, ambiguity persists.
2. **On- and Off-Ramp Friction:** The transfer *on-chain* is fast and cheap, but the ""last mile"" conversion remains problematic. In many emerging markets the primary beneficiaries of low-cost remittances reliable, non-prohibitive cash-out options (local exchanges, agent networks, or bank integrations) are scarce, expensive, or require the recipient to be banked. This friction can wipe out the cost savings.
3. **User Experience & Trust:** For the non-crypto-native user, dealing with wallets, private keys, and understanding blockchain transaction finality is a significant barrier. Furthermore, the solvency and backing of private stablecoin issuers, following incidents like the Terra collapse, necessitate strong regulatory oversight to build consumer confidence akin to traditional bank-backed deposits.

# Scope of Improvement: The Path to the Future

Stablecoins are **not overhyped**; they are an essential piece of the future remittance infrastructure, but their full realization depends on solving the current structural issues:

* **Infrastructure Integration:** The future isn't about *replacing* traditional rails, but *integrating* the stablecoin layer. This means established fintechs and banks building compliant platforms that use stablecoins for the high-speed, low-cost cross-border leg, while keeping the user experience simple (fiat-in, fiat-out). Companies like PayPal, Stripe, and global banks are actively developing these ""rails.""
* **Regulatory Alignment:** Clarity is accelerating. As major jurisdictions establish clear rules for reserve backing, transparency, and compliance (KYC/AML), institutional adoption will transition from pilots to production. This regulated environment will mitigate systemic risk and build trust.
* **Deepening Local Liquidity:** The focus must shift to building robust, low-cost local on- and off-ramps in key remittance corridors (e.g., APAC, Sub-Saharan Africa). Integrating directly with local real-time payment systems and mobile money operators is essential to truly deliver the end-to-end speed and cost benefits to the unbanked and underbanked.

In conclusion, **Stable Coins** are demonstrably the superior technology ...[truncated]","Stablecoins in Remittance: Overhyped or the Future of Cross-Border Payments?

But bringing millions of ‘New to Credit’(NTC), low-income, and rural users into the system requires trust, security, and compliance at scale.RegTech (Regulatory Technology) in India is playing a crucial role in advancing financial inclusion by leveraging technology to simplify, lower costs, and improve efficiency of compliance processes. 

Consider the following situations:

A dhaba owner in ‘Indore’ who sought a small credit line was rejected because his documents did not conform to the “system format.”
A single mother in ‘Mysore’ had a bank account but couldn’t activate it because the officer asked for two different IDs she didn’t have.
A young student in ‘Lucknow’ was stuck for 40+ days because his KYC verification kept failing due to a minor address mismatch.
These are not technology problems. These are compliance bottlenecks. And this is where RegTech quietly becomes the missing engine in India’s financial inclusion journey.

RegTech refers to the application of advanced digital tools to help Financial Institutions and other regulated businesses comply with regulatory requirements more efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively. It is considered a subset of FinTech, focusing specifically on solving Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) challenges. RegTech uses digital tools—AI, ML, APIs,Analytics,Automation—to help financial institutions comply with regulations more efficiently and more accurately. 

In India, RegTech is not “optional”; it is a strategic enabler of financial inclusion, transforming compliance from a costly barrier into an efficient, low-cost mechanism to serve the unbanked and underbanked.RegTech doesn’t make headlines—but it decides -

Whether a poor woman in ‘Bihar’ can open a bank account in five minutes or five months
Whether a digital lender in ‘Jalandhar’ can provide fair credit to a first-time borrower or spend 40% of its resources on manual checks
Whether a migrant worker in ‘Mumbai’ can prove who he is, without having to do so repeatedly to 10 different institutions

The truth is simple: India cannot achieve financial inclusion without fixing compliance. And compliance cannot be fixed without RegTech.

How RegTech Works - 

RegTech leverages technologies like:

• Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): Used for real-time transaction monitoring to detect anomalies, suspicious activities, and potential fraud (e.g., Anti-Money Laundering, or AML). 

• Big Data Analytics: Processing massive volumes of data quickly to assess risk exposure and identify non-compliance patterns.  

• Cloud Computing: Provides scalable and secure platforms for data storage, processing, and collaborative reporting between institutions and regulators.  

• Blockchain: Used for creating tamper-proof and shared audit trails, enhancing transparency and data security

Real-world RegTech Use Case: Small Business Loan Onboarding and Underwriting 

A small shop owner (Priya) with no formal credit history applies for a working capital loan through a digital banking app. The bank uses a RegTech platform to handle the entire process. Here is a concise summary of the 5-step automated flow:

1. Digital KYC: Priya's identity is verified in minutes using Aadhaar e-KYC and a video interview.

2. Data Aggregation: With her consent via the Account Aggregator (AA) framework, her financial data (bank statements, GST invoices) is pulled digitally from various sources.

3. AI Risk Analysis: Machine Learning models analyze her cash flow and business activity to generate a credit score and loan terms.

4. Compliance & Approval: The system auto-checks regulatory blocklists, generates the legal agreement, and flags it for a quick human review.

5. Disbursement & Monitoring: Funds are disbursed, and the system continues to monitor repayments and transactions for fraud.

Key RegTech Use Cases Accelerating India’s Financial Inclusion-

RegTech makes Onboarding low-cost and straightforward
Earlier, Know Your Customer(KYC) was expensive and slow. Opening a bank account for a poor customer meant paperwork, physical verification, and long queues.RegTech digitised the first barrier: Aadhaar e-KYC, Video KYC, Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-based document extraction, DigiLocker integration, PAN/Aadhaar verification APIs.This reduced onboarding costs, making low-income customers profitable to serve.

Outcome: More banks and fintechs can afford to onboard small-ticket customers → greater inclusion.

Fraud prevention builds trust
Low-income customers often avoid formal finance because they think, “Bank mein paisa chala jayega”(The money will go to the bank),” App fraud kar sakti hai”(App will do fraud),” Loan denge aur phir paisa double maangenge”(They will give the loan and then ask for double the money back)

What we don’t talk about enough is the *code* all of this is sitting on.

I’m working on a concept I’m calling **“Tokenized Risk: Banking’s Fatal Code Flaws”**—the idea that we’ve moved from opaque balance sheets to opaque *codebases*, and most people (including execs signing the checks) have no idea how fragile some of these systems really are.

A few patterns I keep seeing/reading about:

* **Technical debt as systemic risk** Many core systems are a Frankenstein stack of mainframes + APIs + third-party platforms. Every “quick integration” adds hidden complexity. At some point, the next patch isn’t just a fix—it’s another fault line.
* **Black-box vendors and “trust me” integrations** Banks plug in tokenization, KYC, fraud, and analytics vendors via SDKs and APIs they barely understand under the hood. If one critical vendor has a logic bug, data leak, or incentive misalignment, the risk is silently multiplied across every client bank.
* **Smart contracts without smart governance** Code is treated as “law,” but: – Who designs the upgrade paths? – Who audits the logic under stress conditions? – Who models how one failing contract interacts with liquidity, limits, or collateral in the *rest* of the system?
* **Composability without guardrails** Open banking + APIs + tokenized assets means we’re wiring multiple institutions together at the code level. That’s powerful—but also how you get *contagion via integration* instead of just via balance sheets.
* **Security models stuck in the old world** Traditional banking security assumes slower movement, human review, and limited interoperability. Tokenized value moves fast, 24/7, and across chains and platforms. A logic flaw or key compromise doesn’t just lose “data”—it can move real value instantly.

What worries me is that this feels similar to pre-2008 structured products: complex, layered, abstracted risk that “works” until one assumption breaks.

So I’m curious how this looks from inside the industry and the dev trenches:

1. If you work in banking/fintech, how much *real* code-level risk analysis and threat modeling is actually happening around tokenization and smart-contract-like systems?
2. Are your orgs treating vendor SDKs/APIs as “safe by default,” or is anyone doing serious independent validation?
3. For devs: what are the most common “fatal” flaws you see in financial code (assumptions, poor error handling, bad state logic, etc.)?
4. Are regulators even asking the *right* technical questions yet, or are we still at the buzzword stage?

I’m not anti-tokenization or anti-innovation—I’m pro-**verified robustness**. If value is being represented in code, then code quality, architecture, and governance *are* financial stability issues.

Would really like to hear from people in:

* banks or credit unions dealing with “digital transformation”
* fintech / DeFi engineers
* security researchers / auditors
* risk/compliance folks who’ve had to translate this up the chain

I own the domain [**TradingForex.ai**](http://tradingforex.ai/) and I’m considering selling it or partnering with someone who can build something meaningful on it.

Before I list it officially, I’d appreciate some honest feedback:

* Does this feel like a strong brand for AI trading or forex automation?
* Would you consider it valuable for bots, copy trading, or signal platforms?
* What kind of startup do you think fits this domain best?

Any insight helps — trying to understand how founders and domain investors see it.

Then my clients forced me to build one anyway.,"I’ve been lurking here for a while and I’m having a bit of a ""pinch me"" moment regarding market saturation vs. niche utility. I wanted to get your take on it.

If you look at the B2B SaaS landscape right now, ""Document Processing"" or ""AI Wrapper for OCR"" feels like the most crowded room at the party. You’ve got the massive incumbents (AWS/Google), a thousand generic startups, and plenty of dev teams trying to roll their own custom solutions.

If you had asked me 6 months ago if the world needed *another* doc processing tool, I would have said absolutely not.

**But here is the weird part:**

We run a marketplace in the lending space. We built some internal tech just to handle our own operations—specifically to process credit and loan applications. While we are very proud of what we've built; it was mainly a utility.

Then, our marketplace clients started looking over our shoulders.

They basically said: *""The tool you’re using to process that? We want that. The stuff we are buying off the shelf isn't working.""*

I was confused because, again, there are so many tools out there. But after digging into their workflows, the gap became obvious.

**The Problem with ""Generic"" Processing in Lending** Most tools are great at standard OCR (reading text off a page). But in the lending world, reading the text is only 10% of the job. The real pain is the **correlation** and the **workflow**:

1. **Contextual Relationships:** It’s not just about extracting a number. It’s about understanding the relationship between Bank Statement A, Statement B, the tax return, and the P&L. Does the story match? any fraudulent signs?
2. **Bank Statement Chaos:** Really accurately processing bank statements is a nightmare for generic tools. Understanding transfers between accounts and distinguishing revenue from capital injections usually requires a human eye. What about bounced checks? recurring existing loan payments etc
3. **Workflow Inertia:** Lenders don't want to change their workflow to fit software. They want software that automates their *existing* workflow.

We realized that because we built our tech specifically for the nuances of credit applications, we were accidentally outperforming the generalist ""market leaders"" for this specific use case. We weren't just reading docs; we were underwriting them.

**The Validation** We decided to spin this tech out as a standalone offering. We are currently in trials with a double-digit number of lending companies, and we’re transitioning the first batch to paid subscriptions this week.

It’s been a massive lesson for me in ""Red Ocean"" markets. Even when a space looks completely full, if the incumbents are solving for ""General Purpose"" and you solve for ""Specific Painful Workflow,"" there is still massive room to move.

**My question for the sub:** Has anyone else here pivoted an internal tool into a product because clients asked for it? How did you navigate the messaging of ""We are just like X, but for Y"" without sounding like a generic clone?","I thought the document processing market was completely saturated.

In the early stages, everyone assumes they’re aligned, everyone believes the relationship will run smoothly, and no one expects serious disagreements. But the first moment of friction is usually enough to expose every gap in the agreement, and vague language that felt harmless at the beginning suddenly becomes expensive to deal with.

Good intent helps build relationships, but clear terms are what protect a business. This difference becomes especially important for fintech companies entering into Service Level Agreements (SLAs), where responsibilities only matter when something goes wrong.

An SLA is not a handshake. It is a binding contract that decides accountability under pressure. Yet many fintech founders either draft SLAs with soft, undefined language or sign vendor agreements without scrutinising the details, assuming that professionalism and goodwill will carry the relationship forward. But once a service fails, disputes appear immediately, and vague language becomes the starting point for litigation rather than collaboration.

**Here is what every fintech SLA needs if you want to avoid that outcome.**

**1. Precise Uptime and Performance Metrics**

Terms like “high availability,” “best efforts,” or even “99.9% uptime” mean very little if you don’t define how they’re calculated. Without clear measurement windows, monitoring methods, exclusions, and compensation rules, you have no enforceable metric and no meaningful remedy when the system fails.

**What must be written clearly**

A strong fintech SLA should define:

• The exact uptime percentage and the measurement window. For payment systems, 99.9% uptime translates to roughly 8 hours and 45 minutes of downtime per year. High-performance providers push for 99.99% or better.

• How uptime will be calculated, including the monitoring tool and whether measurement is monthly, quarterly, or annual.

• What qualifies as downtime, and whether planned maintenance is excluded. If maintenance is excluded, document the notice period.

• The thresholds for compensation, such as service credits when uptime dips below a certain point.

RBI and NPCI now enforce strict SLA discipline for payment systems. Frequent downtime or repeated SLA breaches can trigger penalties, transaction caps, or even regulatory restrictions. If your SLA is vague, you can neither prove a breach nor defend yourself when regulators hold you responsible.

**2. Response Times, Escalation, and Dispute Resolution**

Phrases like “prompt response,” “business hours support,” or “escalation as needed” are almost guaranteed to create disputes. Fintech systems require predictable response times because delays directly affect users, banks, and regulators.

**What must be written clearly**

A well-structured SLA should define:

• Incident severity levels (P1 through P4) with specific criteria. For example, a P1 might be complete system downtime or data corruption.

• Response and resolution targets for each severity. A typical structure is:

P1: Response within 1 hour, resolution within 4–8 hours

P2: Response within 4 hours, resolution within 24 hours

P3/P4: Standard business-hour response

• Clear escalation rules, including when an issue moves from the support team to senior leadership.

• Communication expectations: how often updates will be given and what a post-incident report includes.

• A dispute resolution path with timelines, escalation points, and fallback mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration.

Fintech companies operate under strict regulatory timelines. For example, UPI failed transactions must be reversed within specific timeframes. If your vendor doesn’t meet these deadlines due to weak SLAs, you will still be held accountable even though the failure wasn’t yours.

**3. Compensation, Liability, and Exit Rights**

Phrases like “provider is liable for damages” or “service credits apply” don’t mean much without defining how liability is calculated, what damages are included, and under what circumstances either party can exit the relationship.

**What must be written clearly**

Your SLA should define:

• A structured service credit model linked to uptime percentages.

• A reasonable cap on monthly credits, usually 30–50% of fees.

• Cumulative failure triggers: for instance, the right to terminate if the SLA is breached three months in a row or four times within a year.

• Liability limits, exclusions, and what constitutes a qualifying event.

• Clear termination and offboarding terms, including data return timelines and cooperation requirements.

• A no-waiver clause so that accepting service credits does not prevent you from pursuing other remedies later.

Fintech is high-stakes. Service credits alone rarely compensate for lost transaction volume, regulatory exposure, brand damage, or user churn.

Running an IPTV service and trying to get paid via PayPal is like walking through a minefield. PayPal doesn't mess around with stuff they think violates copyright or their Acceptable Use Policy. Your account can get limited, funds held for 180 days, or just straight-up banned.



So, people talk about using ""Cloak"" tech. Forget sci-fi invisibility. In this game, Cloaking is about disguising your business's true nature from payment processors and banks. It makes your high-risk IPTV transactions look like a bunch of normal, low-risk sales.



Here’s the breakdown of how it’s theorized to work:



The Core Idea: Front-Ends & Back-Ends

You split your operation in two:



· The Front (The ""Face""): A clean, legitimate-looking website. It sells something boring and digital that PayPal loves, like:

  · ""Digital Media Access Keys""

  · ""Software License Renewals""

  · ""Premium Tech Support Plans""

· The Back (The Real Deal): Your actual IPTV panel where users log in with the ""key"" they bought.



How the ""Cloak"" Works in Practice



1.  The Payment Trapdoor



· Customer Action: User signs up on your real IPTV site. At checkout, they click ""Pay with PayPal"".

· The Switch: Instead of sending them to PayPal with an invoice saying ""IPTV Subscription"", your system quietly redirects them to your cloaked front-end website.

· The Clean Transaction: They complete the payment on the front-end site for a ""Software License"" or ""Digital Service"". PayPal only sees this legitimate transaction. The user then receives a license key or activation code.



2.  The Silent Handshake



· Your front-end system automatically sends that unique key to your back-end IPTV system.

· The user enters the key on your IPTV site, and their account gets activated. The payment and the service delivery are completely disconnected in the eyes of PayPal.



3.  Obfuscating the Money Trail



· You can't just withdraw to your main bank account. The move is to use intermediary High-Risk Merchant Accounts or payment gateways that are IPTV-friendly, then spread the money across multiple accounts or use crypto exchanges.

· Some even use a network of shell companies or ""FACT"" (First-Class Airline Ticket) methods to create fake travel expenses to justify the cash flow. This is getting into serious territory.



 THE PART YOU CAN'T IGNORE: Risks & Reality Check



This isn't a lifehack. It's a high-stress operational risk.



· It's a Cat-and-Mouse Game: PayPal and banks have entire fraud departments dedicated to finding patterns like this. They analyze transaction descriptors, website links, and fund flows.

· You Will Get Caught Eventually: Most people do. It's not a matter of if, but when. When PayPal does a review and asks for your business documentation, your ""Software License"" site won't match the customer complaints about IPTV service.

· The Fallout is Severe: You'll lose all the money in your PayPal balance. You'll be banned for life. Your connected bank accounts might get flagged.

· Legal Grey Zone: This veers into potential fraud (misrepresenting a transaction) and money laundering territory, depending on your jurisdiction and scale.



Bottom Line: ""Cloaking"" is a temporary, risky workaround that treats a symptom. It adds massive complexity and points of failure. The consensus is to either structure your business to comply with terms, or use payment methods built for anonymity from the start. Building a real, long-term business on a foundation of transaction deception is a sure way to lose everything you put in.

Yesterday I finished locking down the mission-selection layer, and the performance I’m getting feels… unreal

I built a deterministic, state-isolated “mission selection” function (basically a micro-scheduler that picks the next trade candidate). It runs inside a strict snapshot-only environment, completely pure, no state reads, frozen inputs/outputs, no async drift, fully hydratable and replayable.

Then I stress-tested it.

# Performance results (averaged over 100 iterations each):

**10 candidates:**

* Avg: **0.016 ms**
* P95: **0.1 ms**
* P99: **0.2 ms**

**50 candidates:**

* Avg: **0.019 ms**
* P95: **0.1 ms**
* P99: **0.1 ms**

**100 candidates:**

* Avg: **0.040 ms**
* P95: **0.1 ms**
* P99: **0.2 ms**

**200 candidates (extreme test):**

* Avg: **0.098 ms**
* P95: **0.2 ms**
* P99: **3.1 ms** *Still under the 50ms budget I set.*

Everything is frozen, no mutations, deterministic output, parallel-safe, and replay-safe.

I’m honestly shocked because I assumed JS would choke way earlier — but this engine is slicing through sorted mission queues in under 0.1ms most of the time.

# My question for devs here:

Is this actually impressive/rare?  
Or is this normal when you isolate state properly and avoid non-deterministic branches?

I’m trying to figure out whether I’ve just hit a normal optimisation ceiling… or whether I’ve built something that’s genuinely competitive with the internals of modern trading engines.

Any insight from people with experience in HFT, realtime systems, or algo engines would mean a lot. I’m learning all of this on my own and just want to understand where this sits in the real world.","I think I accidentally built the fastest mission-selection engine anyone’s posted here… (<0.1ms at 200 missions?!)

🔹 About This Newsletter:

I published a periodic newsletter titled “Financial Inclusion Insights” on LinkedIn — where I explore key themes such as inclusive lending, digital-financial access for underserved communities, last-mile adoption of fintech in India, and the intersection of technology with social welfare.

By bringing these topics into the public domain, my aim is to catalyze discussion, awareness, and responsible fintech practices — especially for marginalized groups.

🔹 Why It Matters: Context & Impact:

India stands at a crucial juncture. As fintech and digital-finance technologies scale rapidly, financial inclusion — not just in access but in dignity, fairness, and transparency — must remain at the core.
In this newsletter series, I examine:
The barriers faced by low-income and unbanked populations.
How digital installments and micro-credit models can empower or exploit — depending on design and regulation.
The role of responsible product design for vulnerable communities, including women, single mothers, old age people and daily wage workers.
The importance of social-impact sensibility (e.g. empathy, ethical lending, transparency) — something I deeply care about.
If you are a fintech professional, social entrepreneur, policymaker, or just someone interested in inclusive growth — this newsletter offers a unique blend of analysis, real-world perspective and compassionate design thinking.

🔹 About Me — My Journey & Purpose:

My name is Chitra Sangatwani. I’m a Product Consultant and Writer focused on Financial Inclusion in fintech , but beyond corporate frameworks, I’m deeply committed to social impact.
Through this newsletter, I aim to merge my fintech aspirations with these social values — catalyzing inclusive finance, ethical product design, and social equity.

🔹 What You’ll Find in the Newsletter (and What to Expect):

Every edition is designed to - 
Provide actionable insights on financial inclusion in India
Offer ethical perspective on fintech & micro-credit
Encourage compassionate design — taking into account social realities, inequality & marginalization
Provide cross-sector view: combining fintech, social impact, and inclusive philanthropy
If you care about responsible growth, empathy-driven product design and long-term societal good — there’s something for you here.

🔹 How You Can Support or Engage:

Follow and subscribe to the newsletter on LinkedIn; share it with peers, colleagues, social circles interested in fintech/social-impact.
Engage with posts — comments, shares, feedback — helps visibility.
Spread awareness outside LinkedIn — on Medium, social media, blogs — to build a stronger ecosystem.
If you’re a fintech professional, policymaker, or social-impact enthusiast — collaborate, contribute ideas, share ground-level insights.

👉 Conclusion
In a world racing toward digital finance, we must ensure no one gets left behind — socially, economically, or ethically.
This newsletter is my small contribution toward building a more inclusive, empathetic, and equitable financial ecosystem for India.
Thank you for reading — and for being part of this journey.

# Product Strategies for Human-Centric Design

1. ***Embed Ethnographic Research*** – In UX design ethnography helps teams uncover the unspoken needs , habits , emotions and cultural influences. Its not about asking people what they do - it’s about observing how they actually live to understand the pain points the users may not even articulate.Go beyond surveys. Spend time in the field- listen to how users think about money, savings and debt.

2. ***Design for Digital Dignity*** – Ensure interfaces never make users feel small or uneducated. Replace jargon with relatable, everyday language.

3. ***Localize Deeply*** – Build multilingual, voice-first, and icon-based UX for semi-literate users

4. ***Build Trust Into Design*** – Use transparent consent flows, explain permissions in human language, and highlight safety signals visually.

5. ***Co-Create with Users*** – Test prototypes with actual end-users – SHGs(Self Help Groups) , kirana users or women entrepreneurs – and let their feedback shape the product.

**Put people first before product** to ensure financial systems are usable for all especially for the unbanked, underserved and digitally excluded. It’s not just about UI/UX - it’s about deep ethnographic understanding, co-creation with real users and iterating solutions based on lived realities(languages , literacy , gender , culture and access).

**Technology enables access of digital financial services but it’s the human centred design that can lead to true financial inclusion**. *Forward centric institutions think beyond the technology-first mindset to embrace human-centric mindset an approach that puts humans at the center of the process.*Personalisation isn’t a luxury these days. It’s a trust building mechanism.For India’s next billion users , **personalisation is the key.** *Speak their language(literally and culturally). Meet them at their digital comfort level.*

# Core Principles of Designing for the next billion

· ***Trust by design*** – build transparency, reliability, and emotional comfort before asking for transactions. Trust must be designed in every interaction through transparency, security and clarity.

· ***Vernacular and Visual design*** – Speak the user’s language – literally and emotionally. Full support for at least 10 major Indian languages and the ability to switch easily. Avoid complex financial jargon.

· ***Simplicity in Complexity*** – Simplify cognitive load: remove financial jargon, linearize flows. Use visuals, voice, and minimal steps. Complexity is the enemy of adoption.

· ***Assistive + Self-Serve Hybrid*** – Users may need handholding before independence.

· ***Dignity and Empowerment*** – No one should feel “illiterate” or “less-than” while using technology.

1. **Construct a knowledge graph** from SEC filings (8-Ks, 10-Ks, 10-Qs, credit agreements, amendments, etc.).
2. Use that knowledge graph to **benchmark terms** from a new agreement against “market standard” values.
3. Layer in predictive analytics to model how certain terms are trending over time.

But I’m stuck on one major practical problem:

# How do I reliably extract the relevant deal terms from these documents?

These docs are insanely complex:

* **Structural complexity**
   * Credit agreements can be 100–300+ pages
   * Tons of nested sections and cross-references everywhere (“as defined in Section 1.01”, “subject to Section 7.02(b)(iii)”)
   * Definitions that cascade (Term A depends on Term B, which depends on Term C…)
   * Exhibits/schedules that modify the main text
   * Amendment documents that only contain deltas and not the full context

This makes traditional NER/RE or simple chunking pretty unreliable because terms aren’t necessarily in one clean section.

# What I’m looking for feedback on:

* Has anyone built something similar (for legal/finance/contract analysis)?
* Is a knowledge graph the right starting point, or is there a more reliable abstraction?
* How would you tackle definition resolution and cross-references?
* Any recommended frameworks/pipelines for extremely long, hierarchical, and cross-referential documents?
* How would you benchmark a newly ingested deal term once extracted?
* Would you use RAG, rule-based parsing, fine-tuned LLMs, or a hybrid approach?

Would love to hear how others would architect this or what pitfalls to avoid.

For a long time, I thought prediction markets, “superforecasting”, and AI forecasting techniques had nothing to say about the stock market. Stock prices already reflect the collective wisdom of investors. The stock market is basically a prediction market already.

Recently, though, AI forecasting has gotten competitive with human forecasters. And I think I've found a way of modeling long-term company outcomes that is amenable to an LLM-agent-based forecasting approach.

The idea is to do a Warren Buffett style intrinsic valuation. Produce 5-year and 10-year forecasts of revenue, margins, and payout ratios for every company in the S&P 500. The forecasting workflow reads all the documents, does manager assessments, etc., but it doesn't take the current stock price into account. So the DCF produces a completely independent valuation of the company.

For example, you can see our intrinsic valuations of the S&P 500 which we're calling [Stockfisher Fair Value](https://platform.stockfisher.app). ""Stockfisher"" is a riff on stockfish, the best AI for chess, but also because it fishes through many stocks looking for the steepest discount to fair value.

Scrolling through the results, it finds some really interesting neglected stocks. And when I interrogate the detailed forecasts, I can't find flaws in the analysis, at least not with at least an hour of trying to refute them, Charlie Munger style.

With a powerful combination of innovation, consumer demand, and a supportive regulatory environment, the UK remains the continent’s frontrunner in fintech adoption. This article explores the key drivers behind this acceleration and why the UK continues to outperform its European counterparts.



# 1. A Supportive Regulatory Environment Driving Innovation

One of the strongest catalysts for fintech growth in the UK is its progressive regulatory framework.  
The **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** was among the world’s first regulators to introduce **regulatory sandboxes**, enabling fintech companies to test new products in a controlled environment. Since its launch in 2016, more than **700 firms** have participated in these sandboxes, significantly reducing the barriers to innovation.

In comparison, many European countries still operate under more rigid compliance structures and slower approval timelines. This gives UK fintech firms a time-to-market advantage  crucial in a fast-moving digital economy.



# 2. UK Consumers Are More Digitally Confident

British consumers have shown a higher willingness to adopt new digital tools compared to other European markets.  
According to **Statista**, over **86% of UK adults** use some form of fintech service, whether digital banking, investing, lending, or payments. This adoption rate outperforms major European nations such as Germany (at roughly 70%) and France (around 67%).

Two major consumer behaviours fuel this shift:

* **Preference for convenience**: Customers increasingly favour mobile-first financial services that offer instant payments, smart budgeting tools, and seamless cross-border transfers.
* **Rise of digital banking**: Challenger banks like **Monzo, Revolut, and Starling** have collectively attracted tens of millions of UK users, signalling a strong trust in technology-led banking.



# 3. High Levels of Investment and Startup Activity

The UK is Europe’s largest fintech investment hub. In 2023 alone, UK fintech startups attracted more than **$5.1 billion in funding**, surpassing the combined totals of many EU countries.

Several factors contribute to this momentum:

* **Access to global investors** through London’s financial district
* A strong pool of tech and finance talent
* A mature startup ecosystem with accelerators such as **Level39**, **Barclays Rise**, and **Tech Nation**

This high inflow of capital accelerates product development, customer acquisition, and market expansion  all crucial for rapid adoption.



# 4. Superior Payments Infrastructure

The UK has built one of the world’s most advanced payments ecosystems.  
The introduction of **Open Banking** in 2018 was a major milestone, enabling customers to securely share financial data with trusted third-party providers. As of 2024, more than **7 million UK consumers** actively use open banking-powered services.

In the EU, open banking implementation varies widely by country, leading to fragmented adoption and slower consumer uptake.

The UK’s faster implementation has led to:

* Faster, cheaper, and more transparent digital payments
* Swift rollout of API-driven financial products
* Better customer control over financial data



# 5. Faster Adoption of Cross-Border and FX Fintech Solutions

With the UK’s strong global trading footprint, customers frequently engage in international transactions. This has driven faster adoption of FX and cross-border fintech tools.

Companies like **Wise** and **Remitly** dominate UK usage because they offer:

* Lower foreign exchange fees
* Transparent pricing
* Faster settlement times

In contrast, many European countries still rely heavily on traditional banks for cross-border payments, which typically involve higher fees and slower timelines.



# Conclusion: The UK’s Fintech Advantage Is Set to Grow

The UK’s accelerated fintech adoption is the result of an ecosystem where customer expectations, regulatory support, innovation, and investment align. With continued focus on open banking, digital infrastructure, and global financial connectivity, the UK is well-positioned to remain Europe’s leader in fintech innovation.

For customers, this translates to better choices, more transparency, and more efficient financial services  a trend that will only strengthen in the years ahead.","Why Fintech Adoption in the UK Is Accelerating Faster Than Europe

I’ve been working on a small side project: a visual builder for trading strategies.

The idea came from constantly rewriting the same boilerplate every time I wanted to test something. So I built a system where you:
	•	drag blocks (Indicators, Filters, Entry, Risk, Exit)
	•	the blocks generate structured JSON
	•	the JSON compiles into Python code
	•	the code is instantly backtestable

It’s early and rough, but the pipeline actually works.

My question for this sub:
Does something like this have a place in real FinTech/algo workflows?
Or is this more of a “personal research tool” than something production-viable?

In a lot of emerging markets, you see the same fintech pattern play out:

\- Brazil gets Nubank.

\- Mexico gets Stori/Klar.

\- Nigeria gets Kuda and half a dozen serious players.

It happens when a few things line up at once big diaspora sending money home, decent local payment rails, and some cultural anchor that gives people enough trust to move their money digitally.

Ethiopia looks like it might be heading in that direction.

You’ve got a massive diaspora that’s super financially active. Local fintechs are getting sharper and more connected. And now with Ethiopia floating the USD, the black-market premium is shrinking fast. That alone changes how remittances and cross-border transfers might work—basically removes one of the biggest distortions in the system.

It makes me wonder:

Are we on the edge of an Ethiopian fintech breakout in the US, UK and Canada?

Like, is there room for a neobank/remittance hybrid that links the U.S. diaspora to local rails the way Nubank linked to Brazil or Kuda linked to Nigeria?



Or is the regulatory environment still too early for something big to happen?

Quick backstory - I'm a data and software engineer who's helped a bunch of e-commerce clients and friends get their Stripe funds unfrozen. After looking at about 50 cases over the last 6 months, I noticed something that almost everyone missed. Most merchants think as long as they're under 1% dispute rate, they're fine. That's not how it works.

The problem: Stripe shows you one number, but they're actually tracking something else.

Let me explain with a real example:

Say you have 1,000 transactions and 9 disputes. Your dashboard shows 0.9%. You think ""I'm good, that's under 1%.""

 But here's what Stripe actually sees:

* Visa: 600 transactions, 8 disputes = 1.33%
* Mastercard: 400 transactions, 1 dispute = 0.25%

They track each card network separately. And here's the current thresholds (as of Nov 2025):

* Visa: 1.5% (drops to 0.9% on January 1, 2026 - only 2 months away)
* Mastercard: 1.5%
* Amex: 1.0%

Many payment processors also monitor around 0.75% as industry guidance (not an official Stripe policy, but common practice due to acquirer portfolio requirements).Why processors monitor below official limits:

Payment processors like Stripe are acquirers, which means Visa monitors THEIR portfolio. If Stripe's overall average hits 0.5%, Visa fines them. So processors can't afford to let individual merchants get too close to the official limits. They monitor proactively to keep their portfolio healthy.

The other thing that kills people: Mastercard uses a different formula than what your dashboard shows. They divide current month disputes by PREVIOUS month transactions. If you had a big month last month and slow sales this month, your Mastercard rate might be way higher than you think. Oh, and one more thing: Visa's threshold drops from 1.5% to 0.9% on January 1, 2026. That's only 2 months away. If you're sitting at 1.2% thinking you're safe, you won't be in January.

Why I'm posting this:

I got tired of manually calculating this stuff in Excel for people, so I built a tool that connects to your Stripe account (read-only) and monitors the actual network-specific thresholds - both the official ones AND industry guidance levels. It basically alerts you before you hit the danger zone so you can refund a few orders and stay under the limit.
